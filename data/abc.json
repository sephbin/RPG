	"content": "ABSOLUTE DIRECTION'''</font> |- | style=text-align:right; | <font size=3>''5 or 10 points''</font> |- |{{Indent}}You have an excellent sense of direction. This ability comes in two levels: {{Indent}}Absolute Direction: You always know which way is north, and you can always retrace a path you have followed within the past month, no matter how faint or confusing. This ability does not work in environments such as interstellar space or the limbo of the astral plane, but it does work underground, underwater, and on other planets. This gives +3 to Body Sense and Navigation (Air, Land, or Sea). (Note: The navigational sense that guides migratory creatures to their destination is too crude to qualify; treat it as a 0-point feature.) 5 points. {{Indent}}3D Spatial Sense: As above, but works in three dimensions. This ability is useful in deep space - although it does not help you if you travel across dimensions. You get the skill bonuses given for Absolute Direction, plus +1 to Piloting and +2 to Aerobatics, Free Fall, and Navigation (Hyperspace or Space). 10 points. {{Indent}} ---- <font size=3>'''Special Limitations'''</font> {{Indent}}Requires Signal: You rely on signals from a navigational satellite network (like Earth's GPS) or similar system. Your ability does not function in the absence of such a system, and it can be jammed. -20%. |}"
