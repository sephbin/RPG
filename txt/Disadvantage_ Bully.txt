|{{Indent}}You like to push people around whenever you can get away with it. Depending on your personality and position, this might take the form of physical attacks, intellectual harassment, or social &quot;cutting.&quot; Make a selfcontrol roll to avoid gross bullying when you know you shouldn't - but to roleplay your character properly, you should bully anybody you can. Since nobody likes a bully, others react to you at -2.
