|{{Indent}}You react poorly toward those who seem smarter, more attractive, or better off than you! You resist any plan proposed by a &quot;rival,&quot; and hate it if someone else is in the limelight. (Jealousy goes well with Megalomania.) If an NPC is jealous, the GM will apply a -2 to -4 reaction penalty toward the victim(s) of his jealousy.
