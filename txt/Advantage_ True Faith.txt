|{{Indent}}You have a profound religious faith that protects you from &quot;evil&quot; supernatural beings such as demons and vampires. To enjoy this protection, you must actively assert your faith by wielding a physical symbol revered by your religion (e.g., crucifix, Torah, or Koran), chanting, dancing, or whatever else is appropriate to your beliefs. If you wish to use this ability in combat - to repel zombies, for instance - then you must choose the Concentrate maneuver each turn, and can do nothing else.

{{Indent}}For as long as you assert your faith, no malign supernatural entity (GM's judgment as to what this covers) may approach within one yard of you. If one is forced into this radius, it must leave by the most direct route possible, as if it suffered from Dread (p. 132). If it cannot leave without coming closer, it must make a Will roll. On a success, it may run past you to escape, pushing you aside if necessary (but using only the minimum force required to escape). On a failure, the monster is cowed. It must cower, helplessly, and cannot move, defend itself, or take any other action.

{{Indent}}To keep True Faith, you must behave in a manner consistent with your religion. You will nearly always have to take and adhere to one or more of the traits listed under Self-Imposed Mental Disadvantages (p. 121). In effect, True Faith comes with a built-in Pact limitation (p. 113); do not apply this modifier again. You do not have to be kind, loving, or law-abiding, however. A violent bigot or religious terrorist can be just as sincere in his religious devotion as a saintly ascetic.

{{Indent}}True Faith (Chosen): You enjoy all the benefits of True Faith, but your power is due to the fact that your god has chosen to act through you - possibly without your consent. Barring egregious transgressions, your advantage functions regardless of your actual faith. This comes at a cost, however: non-supernatural servitors of rival deities can sense your special status and react to you at -3 . . . and your True Faith can't repel these foes. 15 points.

{{Indent}}Turning: You can aggressively &quot;turn&quot; the entities your True Faith repels. Take a Concentrate maneuver and roll a Quick Contest of Will with any such being that can see you. Roll just once for hordes of identical monsters with the same Will. Any creature you win or tie against can't move any closer to you than yards equal to your margin of victory (minimum one yard). If it's inside that radius, it must flee as described for unmodified True Faith. This effect endures for as long as you concentrate and for 1d seconds after you stop. +65%.
