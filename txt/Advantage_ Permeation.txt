|{{Indent}}You can move through a particular solid material as if it didn't exist. You do not open a passage behind you; observers just see you &quot;melt&quot; into the surface and disappear. You need Penetrating Vision (p. 74) to see where you're going. You must still breathe (unless you have Doesn't Breathe), which limits trips to the length of time you can hold your breath (see Holding Your Breath, p. 351).

{{Indent}}Permeation differs from Insubstantiality. You are affected by gravity, and you are limited to normal movement; if you lack Flight or another movement advantage, you must walk at your Basic Move. Furthermore, you can be affected by any attack that can reach you within a solid object. You also remain vulnerable to attacks with the material you can pass through, unless you purchase Damage Resistance to such attacks.

{{Indent}}Cost depends on how often you are likely to encounter the material you can permeate in the form of a barrier. For instance, paper might be a &quot;Common&quot; substance, but since walls of paper are uncommon, it is treated as &quot;Rare&quot; for the purpose of Permeation.

{{Indent}}Very Common: Earth (including clay, mud, and sand), metal, stone (including brick, concrete, and plaster), wood, and other ubiquitous structural materials. 40 points.

{{Indent}}Common: Concrete, plastic, steel, and other specific, common structural materials. 20 points.

{{Indent}}Occasional: Glass, ice (including snow), sand, and anything else that a normal person could eventually break or tunnel through using muscle power, as well as somewhat unusual structural materials, such as aluminum and copper. 10 points.

{{Indent}}Rare: Bone, flesh, paper, and other materials rarely encountered in large quantities or as barriers. 5 points.

&lt;font size=&quot;3&quot;&gt;'''Special Enhancements'''&lt;/font&gt;

{{Indent}}Can Carry Objects: Normally, you cannot carry anything while moving through matter. This enhancement lets you carry objects, including clothing and armor. If dropped, they &quot;pop&quot; into open space at the point where you entered the material. You cannot leave things inside solid matter! No encumbrance is +10%; Light, +20%; Medium, +50%; Heavy, +100%.

{{Indent}}Tunnel: You can leave a tunnel (of about your size) behind you, if you choose. This rearranges the object you are moving though without inflicting damage, and does not work at all on living targets. For an ability that can rip holes in objects and people, see Innate Attack (p. 61). +40%.

{{Indent}}Extended: You can pass through multiple, similar materials. Buy the most expensive one at full price. Each additional, related substance is +20%. For instance, someone with Permeation (Stone) could add Extended, Earth and Metal for +40%.

{{Indent}}Meld 1: You can become one with the things you permeate, like a dryad merging with her tree. This works only on discrete objects - a tree (not a forest), a mountain (not a planet), etc. Once melded, you can use your senses from or step out of the object at any point along its interior or exterior surfaces, and can breathe if any part of it is touching air. Take a Ready maneuver to shift viewpoints or exit the object. If the object takes damage, it affects you proportionally; e.g., 10 HP of injury to a 100 HP tree results in a 1 HP wound for a 10 HP man. Being part of something larger than you also blunts Afflictions: add the difference between its SM and yours to your resistance roll. If you have attacks that affect those touching or standing near you, like Emanations, they're &quot;spread thin&quot; if you merge with a large object: scale down damage in proportion to HP (to 1/10 normal, in the above example), and add the difference between the object's SM and your own to rolls to resist your Afflictions. You can't control the items you meld with; get Possession for that. +150%.

{{Indent}}Meld 2: As Meld 1, but works even on distributed objects. With Permeation (Earth), you could meld with the ground at your feet to cross the entire planet in the blink of an eye; with Permeation (Wood), you could meld with a forest to traverse it instantly or spy on events within. +300%.

{{Indent}}Finite Thickness: You can only pass through a barrier of limited thickness. If you try to move through anything thicker, you penetrate as far as your limit and then run into a solid obstacle. Value depends on thickness: -50% for a thin membrane (like a curtain), -30% for an inch, -15% for a foot, and -5% for the distance you can sprint in a second.
