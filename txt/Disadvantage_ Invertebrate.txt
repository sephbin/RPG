|{{Indent}}You have no spine, exoskeleton, or other natural body support. Use your full Basic Lift for the purpose of pushing, but only 1/4 your BL to calculate the weight you can lift, carry, or pull. This trait has a small side benefit, however: you can squeeze through much smaller openings than your size might suggest!

{{Indent}}Note that this trait differs somewhat from the biological term &quot;invertebrate.&quot;
