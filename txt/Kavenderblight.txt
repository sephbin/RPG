Kavenderblight
Kanvenderblight is a desolate wasteland to some. It rarely rains and life struggles to survive in the barren climate. The earth here is dark and colourless, dry hard and cracked from sun exposure or sand and light like ash.
Kavenderblight is home to Dwarves and Nomadic Humans, the Katanese.
The Kavenderblight Dwarves are an unusual Dwarvish race, they pride themselves on scholarly activities and are less hostile to other races in social situations. Many ask why they haven’t left the billowing wastes, but the dwarves don’t entirely understand either. There seems to be a bond between them and the land, a bond the Kaitanese lack, which is why they cannot settle, and must follow packs of animals and the weather.
Deep in the Kanvenderblight wasteland is a large temple devoted to the Camel god Kahbedjim. The temple is built into a large stone monolith that stands as a sentinel over the dusty oblivion. Not only is it a major landmark, it contains a minor cardinal node, making the rock a key stone far all who travel the wasteland.
Acolytes use the monolith as an idol of Khabedjim, a library and safe haven. The rock retains water and collects inside near the base in a moderately sized oasis. Travellers call the monolith “The Pyre of Oblivion”, worshippers of Khabedjim gave named it “Da’ Kashitah”.
