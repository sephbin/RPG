|{{Indent}}You are as susceptible to injury as anyone else, but you don't feel it as much. You never suffer a shock penalty when you are injured. In addition, you get +3 on all HT rolls to avoid knockdown and stunning - and if you are tortured physically, you get +3 to resist. The GM may let you roll at Will+3 to ignore pain in other situations.

{{Indent}}High Pain Threshold is included in Supernatural Durability (p. 89); if you have the latter advantage, you cannot take this one.
