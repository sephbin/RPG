|{{Indent}}You can only be active when the sun is below the horizon. This represents more than a preference for night over day! As soon as dawn starts to break, you become lethargic - and when the sun clears the horizon, you fall paralyzed and comatose until the sun goes down again.

{{Indent}}Note that this is not the same as the biological term &quot;nocturnal.&quot;

{{Indent}}Special Enhancements

{{Indent}}Permanent Paralysis: You turn to stone or suffer some other permanent incapacitation if struck by the sun's rays. Only one specific power or item - most often a powerful magic spell - can reverse this effect. Details are up to the GM. +100%.
