|{{Indent}}You take grossly unreasonable risks in the face of mortal danger. Make a self-control roll whenever you face a life-threatening situation: piloting a burning vehicle, staring down an entire street gang while armed only with a toothbrush, etc. If you fail, you may not back down from the challenge - but you may roll again after every success roll or reaction roll relating to the situation. This might be once per second in a potential combat situation but only once per day on a dangerous space mission.

{{Indent}}In combat, make a self-control roll every time you take your turn. If you fail, you must make an All-Out attack or engage in some other kind of nearinsane, suicidal behavior.

{{Indent}}Most people think you're crazy if they witness this behavior, giving -2 on reaction rolls. Individuals who value bravery over self-preservation (GM's decision) will react at +2.
