|{{Indent}}You are often mistaken for someone else. Your “double’s” allies approach you and tell you things you don’t want to know, and his acquaintances will treat you in strange and irritating ways. His enemies are after you, too! You might eventually get things straightened out, but not without some effort.

{{Indent}}If every member of your race looks the same, your race qualifies for a bizarre feature (see Features and Taboo Traits, p. 261), but you do not have Mistaken Identity.
