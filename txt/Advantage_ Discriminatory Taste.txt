|{{Indent}}This talent functions in most ways like Discriminatory Smell (above), but enhances the sense of taste instead, so tracking is not possible. You must ingest a small quantity of the material to be examined; for a living subject, this means bodily fluids. This gives you an IQ roll to recognize the taste, identify whether a substance is safe to eat, etc. You can perform a detailed &quot;analysis&quot; with a roll against a suitable skill (Chemistry, Cooking, Pharmacy, Poisons . . .). You get +4 (in addition to any Acute Taste and Smell bonuses) on any task that utilizes the sense of taste.

{{Indent}}Profiling: You possess an extensive mental database of sensory &quot;signatures&quot; that you can quickly compare to new sensory impressions. This doubles the bonus to analyze and recognize targets (but not to sense or track them) to +8. As a side benefit, all attempts to memorize new signatures succeed automatically - there's no need for an IQ roll. +50%.
