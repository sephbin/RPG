|{{Indent}}You have an attack that can hold your target in place. Specify how this works when you buy the advantage: entangling your victim in vines, tying him up with webs, freezing him inside a block of ice, turning the ground to quicksand beneath his feet, etc.

{{Indent}}Binding is a ranged attack with 1/2D -, Max 100, Acc 3, RoF 1, Shots N/A, and Recoil 1. You can add modifiers to change these statistics (see pp. 101-116).

{{Indent}}On a hit, your victim is grappled (see p. 370) and rooted in place. He cannot select the Move or Change Posture maneuvers or change facing, and is at -4 to DX. The ST of this effect is equal to your Binding level, but you can layer additional attacks on a successfully bound victim. Each extra layer gives +1 to ST. To break free, the victim must win a Quick Contest of ST or Escape skill against the ST of your Binding. Each attempt takes one second. If the victim fails to break free, he loses 1 FP but may try again. Alternatively, he may try to destroy the Binding. Innate Attacks hit automatically; other attacks are at -4. External attacks on the Binding take no penalty, but risk hitting the victim on a miss (see Striking Into a Close Combat, p. 392). The Binding has DR equal to 1/3 your level (rounded down). Each point of damage reduces ST by one. At ST 0, the Binding is destroyed and the victim is freed.

{{Indent}}To simulate vines, webs, and so forth, add one or more of Area Effect (p. 102), Persistent (p. 107), and Wall (p. 109) - and possibly some of the special modifiers below.

{{Indent}}&quot;&quot;&quot;Egsample&quot;&quot;&quot;

{{Indent}}Bonds: In its simplest form, Binding ensnares the target with some kind of physical &quot;rope.&quot; This doesn't require special modifiers - but the two most common examples are webbing, which is Sticky (+20%), and the ability to cause existing vegetation to entangle the target, which is Environmental (-40%).

{{Indent}}Encasement: Individuals with the power to command elemental forces can sometimes materialize ice, stone, etc. around a foe, sealing him inside. Simulate this with Engulfing (+60%). Almost any attack can eventually chip away the material, so Only Damaged By X and Unbreakable are rarely appropriate.

{{Indent}}Entombment: Another common elemental attack is turning the earth beneath the victim's feet to mud or quicksand, causing him to sink into the ground. Wizards and evil priests might even command the ground to open up and swallow him! This is Engulfing (+60%), Unbreakable (+40%), and likely Suffocating (+75%). Since it only affects those who are touching the ground and not flying or standing on an artificial surface, it's also Environmental (-20%).

{{Indent}}Force Fields: Supers and wizards often restrain opponents with mysterious forces. Such Bindings are Unbreakable (+40%) and in most cases One-Shot (-10%). If the target is actually &quot;tied up&quot; - not just rooted in place - add Engulfing (+60%).

{{Indent}}Goo: Some monsters &quot;slime&quot; their prey with sticky goo. This glues the victim's arms to his sides, clogs his mouth, and leaves him helpless. Represent this with Engulfing (+60%), Only Damaged By Burning or Corrosion (+20%), and Sticky (+20%). Range is often limited; if so, add Reduced Range (-10%/level).

{{Indent}}These attacks bind a single foe. To affect more than one target by blanketing the area with webbing, quicksand, creeping vines, etc., add Area Effect (+50%/level). If the effect endures, and affects anyone who blunders into it, take Persistent (+40%), too. And if the persistent effect forms a vision-impeding barrier (like dense spider webs), stack Wall (+30% or +60%) on top of that.

&lt;font size=&quot;3&quot;&gt;'''Special Enhancements'''&lt;/font&gt;

{{Indent}}Engulfing: Your attack pins the target. He cannot move his limbs or speak; his only options are to use purely mental abilities, to attack the Binding with an Innate Attack, or to try to break free using ST (not Escape skill). If he tries to break free and fails, he is only allowed a repeated attempt every 10 seconds - and on a 17 or 18, he becomes so entangled that he cannot escape on his own! +60%.

{{Indent}}Only Damaged By X: Only specific damage types can damage your Binding. +30% for one of burning, corrosion, crushing, or cutting; +20% for any two; +10% for any three. Sticky: Your Binding is treated as Persistent (p. 107), but only affects those who actually touch the original target of your attack. +20%.

{{Indent}}Unbreakable: Your Binding cannot be destroyed. The only way to escape is to break free. +40%.

{{Indent}}Constricting: Your Binding actively constricts the victim. Until he breaks free, the Binding attacks him each turn with a Constriction Attack (p. B43), at a ST equal to that of the Binding. +75%.

{{Indent}}Suffocating: Your Binding cocoons the target or blocks his breathing passages. While it's in place, the victim cannot breathe. If he runs out of breath before he breaks free (see Holding Your Breath, p. B351), he starts to suffocate; see Suffocation (p. B436). +75%.

{{Indent}}

&lt;font size=&quot;3&quot;&gt;'''Special Limitations'''&lt;/font&gt;

{{Indent}}Environmental: Your Binding manipulates an existing condition or object in the environment, and won't work in its absence. This is worth from -20% (victim must be touching the ground) to -40% (victim must be standing in dense vegetation), at the GM's option.

{{Indent}}One-Shot: You cannot layer your Binding to increase its ST. -10%.
