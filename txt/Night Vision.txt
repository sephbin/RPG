Your eyes adapt rapidly to darkness.
Each level of this ability (maximum
nine levels) allows you to ignore
-1 in combat or vision penalties due to
darkness, provided there is at least
some light.

''Example: Night Vision 4 would completely eliminate darkness penalties up to -4, and would reduce a penalty of -7 to only -3.''
