An average life cycle is defined as
maturity at age 18, with aging effects
(see p. 444) starting at age 50 and
accelerating at ages 70 and 90. Each
level of Extended Lifespan doubles all
these values. Note that if you need to
take more than seven levels of this
trait (giving maturity at age 2,304 and
the onset of aging at age 6,400), it is
more efficient to take Unaging (p. 95).
