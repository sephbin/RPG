|{{Indent}}You have a health problem or structural weakness that leaves you prone to catastrophic system failure if you suffer enough damage. Each level of Easy to Kill gives -1 to HT rolls made for survival at -HP or below, and on any HT roll where failure would mean instant death (e.g., heart failure). This does not affect most normal HT rolls - only those to avoid certain death. You may not reduce your HT roll below 3. For instance, if you have HT 10, you are limited to Easy to Kill 7.
