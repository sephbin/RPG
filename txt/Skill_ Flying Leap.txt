|{{Indent}}This skill allows you to make incredible leaps. It costs 1 FP per attempt, successful or not

{{Indent}}On a success, you may immediately attempt a jump. Use the standard jumping rules (see Jumping, p. 352), but triple your jumping distance. On a failure, you may still attempt the jump, but you receive no bonus and make all jumping-related rolls at -5. On a critical failure, you fall down!

{{Indent}}You may use Flying Leap to jump into someone as part of an attack. Such attacks are at an extra -2 to hit, but if you do hit, triple your ST for damage and knockback purposes. In a slam or collision, calculate Move from jumping distance as described for Super Jump (p. 89), and use this velocity to calculate damage

{{Indent}}&lt;font color=&quot;#006AFF&quot; size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Modifiers: -10 if used instantly, dropping to -5 after 1 turn of concentration, -4 after 2 turns, -3 after 4 turns, -2 after 8 turns, -1 after 16 turns, and no penalty after 32 turns.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;
