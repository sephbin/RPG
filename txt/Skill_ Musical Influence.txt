|{{Indent}}This cinematic skill allows you to influence the emotions of others by playing a musical instrument or singing. In some settings, this is a magical or psionic talent, or a special form of hypnotism, and works with any instrument, as well as with voice. In other settings, this skill is associated with a specific type of magical or ultra-tech instrument

{{Indent}}To attempt Musical Influence, you must first get your audience to sit and listen to your performance. You must also make a successful Musical Instrument or Singing roll. You may then roll against your Musical Influence skill. On a success, you can adjust the reaction roll of your audience - to you or to anyone present - up or down by an amount equal to your margin of success, to a maximum of +3 (+4 for critical success)

{{Indent}}If you have only a few seconds, or if the audience is not paying full attention to your performance, you may adjust reaction rolls by Â±1 at most, regardless of your margin of success

{{Indent}}Listeners who do not wish to be influenced may resist with Will. Hard of Hearing (p. 138) gives +4 to resist, and those with Deafness (p. 129) are completely immune. However, some science-fiction devices generate vibrations that affect the body, in which case a listener's sense of hearing is irrelevant

{{Indent}}It is up to the GM to determine whether this skill works on animals as well as sapient beings. In classic fantasy, it just might!
