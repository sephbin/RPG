|{{Indent}}This is the skill of negotiating, compromising, and getting along with others. You may substitute a Diplomacy roll for any reaction roll in a noncombat situation, as described under Influence Rolls (p. 359)

{{Indent}}Unlike other Influence skills, Diplomacy never gives a worse result than if you had tried an ordinary reaction roll. Failure with Fast-Talk or Sex Appeal alienates the subject, but Diplomacy is usually safe

{{Indent}}A successful roll also allows you to predict the possible outcome of a course of action when you are negotiating, or to choose the best approach to take

{{Indent}}If you know Diplomacy at level 20 or better, you get a +2 bonus on all reaction rolls!

{{Indent}}&lt;font color=&quot;#006AFF&quot; size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Modifiers: +2 for Voice (p. 97); -3 for Low Empathy (p. 142); -1 for Oblivious (p. 146); -1 to -4 for Shyness (p. 154); -2 for Stuttering (p. 157).&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;
