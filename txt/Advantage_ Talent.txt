|{{Indent}}You have a natural aptitude for a set of closely related skills. &quot;Talents&quot; come in levels, and give the following benefits:

{{Indent}}* A bonus of +1 per level with all affected skills, even for default use. This effectively raises your attribute scores for the purpose of those skills only; thus, this is an inexpensive way to be adept at small class of skills. (Generalists will find it more costeffective to raise attributes.)

{{Indent}}* A bonus of +1 per level on all reaction rolls made by anyone in a position to notice your Talent, if he would be impressed by your aptitude (GM's judgment). To receive this bonus, you must demonstrate your Talent - most often by using the affected skills.

{{Indent}}* A reduction in the time required to learn the affected skills in play, regardless of how you learn them. Reduce the time required by 10% per level of Talent; e.g., Animal Friend 2 would let you learn animal-related skills in 80% the usual time. This has no effect on the point cost of your skills.

{{Indent}}You may never have more than four levels of a particular Talent. However, overlapping Talents can give skill bonuses (only) in excess of +4.

{{Indent}}&lt;font size=&quot;3&quot;&gt;'''Cost of Talents'''&lt;/font&gt;

{{Indent}}The cost of a Talent depends on the size of the group of skills affected:

{{Indent}}Small (6 or fewer related skills): 5 points/level.

{{Indent}}Medium (7 to 12 related skills): 10 points/level.

{{Indent}}Large (13 or more related skills): 15 points/level.

{{Indent}}Skills with multiple specialties are considered to be one skill for this purpose.

{{Indent}}Once you buy a Talent, the list of affected skills is fixed. (Exception: The GM may rule that a Talent affects new skills appearing in later GURPS supplements, or skills he invents in the course of the campaign, if the Talent would logically be of value to those skills.)

{{Indent}}&lt;font size=&quot;3&quot;&gt;'''Custom Talents'''&lt;/font&gt;

{{Indent}}At the GM's option, you may create your own Talent with a custom skill list. However, the GM's word is law when determining which skills are &quot;related&quot; and how may points the Talent is worth. Talents should always be believable inborn aptitudes. For instance, Sports Talent might make sense - some athletes really do seem to have a gift - but the GM ought to forbid Ninja Talent or Weapon Talent (but see Weapon Master, p. 99).
