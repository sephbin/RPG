|{{Indent}}You have an incapacitating supernatural reaction to an ordinarily innocuous substance. If you touch or breathe the substance, you must immediately make a HT roll. On a failure, you are at -5 to all skills and attributes for the next 10 minutes. If you ingest the substance, you are at -5 to attributes and -10 to all skills and Sense rolls for 10 minutes. Point value depends on the rarity of the substance:

{{Indent}}Occasional (leather, soap): -5 points.

{{Indent}}Common (smoke, wood): -10 points.

{{Indent}}Very Common (grass, metal): -15 points.

{{Indent}}This reaction is physical in nature. For mental aversions, see Dread (p. 132).
