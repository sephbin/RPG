The Ivory Triangle
The Monoliths of Bone are ominous artefacts from a time long forgotten. They produce an isosceles triangle through the Kavenderblight Wastelands, with many scholars claiming it is these monoliths that causes the region to wither.
The monoliths are giant pillars made of polished bone, they appear solid as if the bone was once made from a creature larger than a continent. The monoliths float in mid air, with enough clearance for an asbjorn to walk beneath. Nothing is known about these pillars apart from the strange effect they have on dead bodies and carcasses. A large corridor, 1 km wide, spans from each monolith to the next, where every dead bone aligns to the pillars. The force is strongest closest to the pillars. Large fields of bones spread outward at each pillar as well, all pointing back in to the triangle. The bones rarely decay, and many a unter would admit that some bones are from creatures long extinct.
What is most ominous of the monoliths are the deep dark holes that cut into the earth as seamlessly as the pillars cut through the sky. The deep abyss has never been explored, only a few; like [[Sir Alexander Harrod]] have attempted to speluch into the dept, but their resources never lasted them long enough to find the bottom.
Sir Harrod claimed the holes must puncter the skin of Eorith, and truly what they found was depths of nothing man had originaly reared its head from.
