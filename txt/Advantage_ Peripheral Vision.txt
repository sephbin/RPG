|{{Indent}}You have an unusually wide field of vision. You can see a 180° arc in front of you without turning your head, and have 30° of peripheral vision to either side of that. This gives you a 240° &quot;arc of vision&quot; for observation and ranged attacks. The figure above [[pic]] shows the arc of vision for a normal character (white) and for someone with Peripheral Vision (gray plus white).

{{Indent}}If you are playing with a battle map, you can make melee attacks into &quot;side&quot; (&quot;right&quot; and &quot;left&quot;) hexes as well as &quot;front&quot; hexes - although a onehanded attack to the opposite side (e.g., attacking your left hex with your right hand) is clumsy and considered a Wild Swing (see p. 388). You still cannot attack a foe directly behind you except with a Wild Swing.

{{Indent}}This also helps on defense! If you are attacked from a &quot;side&quot; hex, you defend at no penalty. Even against attacks from the rear, your active defense is only at -2.

{{Indent}}Out of combat, you get +3 to all rolls to detect Shadowing attempts or ambushes from behind, and the GM will always make a Vision roll for you to spot dangers &quot;behind your back.&quot;

&lt;font size=&quot;3&quot;&gt;'''Special Limitations'''&lt;/font&gt;

{{Indent}}Easy to Hit: Your eyes are on stalks, unusually large, or otherwise more vulnerable to attack. Others can target your eyes from within their arc of vision at only -6 to hit. -20%.
