|{{Indent}}This is the ability to act on the stage or screen. It is different from Acting in that you are trying to impress and entertain people - not deceive them. If you studied this skill formally, it includes the knowledge expected of a professional actor from your culture and tech level (stage directions, actor-agent-producer relations, etc.)
