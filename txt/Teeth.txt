Anyone with a mouth has blunt
teeth that can bite for thrust-1 crushing
damage. This costs 0 points, and is
typical of most herbivores. You have a
more damaging bite:

''Sharp Teeth:'' Like those of most carnivores.
Inflict thrust-1 cutting damage.
''1 point.''

''Sharp Beak:'' Like that of a bird of
prey. Inflicts thrust-1 large piercing
damage. ''1 point.''

''Fangs:'' Like those of a Smilodon.
Inflict thrust-1 impaling damage. ''2 points.''
