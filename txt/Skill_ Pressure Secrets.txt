|{{Indent}}This skill represents knowledge of the most vulnerable vital points of the human body. It allows you to maim and kill by crushing and tearing vital organs and nerve clusters with deadly precision

{{Indent}}To use this ability, you must make a successful unarmed attack. This attack is at -2 in addition to any hit location modifier (see Hit Location, p. 398). If you hit, make a Pressure Secrets roll

{{Indent}}On a success, any damage that penetrates DR is doubled - or tripled if you targeted the vital organs. In effect, your hands and feet have become impaling weapons!

{{Indent}}You can also use this ability with locks and similar grappling attacks. This represents knowledge of exactly where to apply pressure to tear or sprain joints and ligaments. After applying the lock, make a Pressure Secrets roll. On a success, double the damage, shock, or harmful effects of the lock for that turn

{{Indent}}This skill is unrealistic and potentially unbalancing. The GM should carefully weigh its impact before allowing it, and may wish to make it very difficult for PCs to learn - or even restrict it to deadly NPC opponents

{{Indent}}&lt;font color=&quot;#006AFF&quot; size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Modifiers: Physiology modifiers (p. 181).&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;
