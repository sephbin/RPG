|{{Indent}}Your foes can take this item from you, depriving you of its benefits. This is only a limitation if the item is obviously powerful and likely to be the target of theft! The value of the limitation depends on how hard it is to steal:

{{Indent}}Easily snatched with an unopposed DX roll (e.g., a hat): -40%.

{{Indent}}Thief must win a Quick Contest of DX (e.g., a bracelet) or ST (e.g., a wand) with you: -30%.

{{Indent}}Can only by taken by stealth or trickery (e.g., a coin in a pocket): -20%.

{{Indent}}Must be forcefully removed (e.g., a suit of armor): -10%.

{{Indent}}Halve the value of the limitation if the gadget will not immediately work for the thief.
