|{{Indent}}An attack normally has a &quot;signature&quot;: a flash of light, a sound, etc. If left unspecified, this is assumed to be similar to a gunshot or a stroke of lightning - that is, a brilliant flash and a loud report. This enhancement makes your attack less obvious.

{{Indent}}Low Signature: The attack is no more easily identifiable as an attack than the loud pop of a champagne cork; e.g., a suppressed pistol shot. +10%.

{{Indent}}No Signature: The attack is almost completely unnoticeable; e.g., a blowgun's dart. Alternatively, it is utterly undetectable by normal means, but leaves a magical or psionic trace. +20%.
