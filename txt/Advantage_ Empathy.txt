|{{Indent}}You have a &quot;feeling&quot; for people. When you first meet someone - or are reunited after an absence - you may ask the GM to roll against your IQ. He will tell you what you &quot;feel&quot; about that person. On a failed IQ roll, he will lie! This talent is excellent for spotting impostors, possession, etc., and for determining the true loyalties of NPCs. You can also use it to determine whether someone is lying . . . not what the truth is, but just whether they are being truthful with you.

{{Indent}}This advantage works only on sapient (IQ 6+), natural beings. The equivalent talents for animals, plants, and supernatural entities are Animal Empathy (p. 40), Plant Empathy (p. 75), and Spirit Empathy (p. 88), respectively.

{{Indent}}This advantage comes in two levels:

{{Indent}}Sensitive: Your ability is not entirely reliable; the IQ roll is at -3. You get &quot;+1 to your Detect Lies and Fortune- Telling skills, and to Psychology rolls to analyze a subject you can converse with. 5 points.

{{Indent}}Empathy: Your ability works at full IQ, and the bonus to Detect Lies, Fortune-Telling, and Psychology is +3. 15 points.

&lt;font size=&quot;3&quot;&gt;'''Special Enhancements'''&lt;/font&gt;

{{Indent}}Remote: Your ability isn't limited to direct, personal meetings. You can &quot;read&quot; any subject you can see or hear - even over electronic media (or by supernatural means, for Spirit Empathy). +50%.

{{Indent}}Specialized: The Specialized limitations for Speak With Animals (see p. B87) and Speak With Plants (see p. 77) are equally valid on Animal Empathy and Plant Empathy, respectively. Spirit Empathy already includes this limitation.
