|{{Indent}}You can fight or otherwise act equally well with either hand, and never suffer the -4 DX penalty for using the &quot;off&quot; hand (see p. 14). Note that this does not allow you to take extra actions in combat - that's Extra Attack (p. 53). Should some accident befall one of your arms or hands, assume it is the left one.
