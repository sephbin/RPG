|{{Indent}}You have an exceptionally good memory. Anyone may attempt an IQ roll to recall the general sense of past events - the better the roll, the truer the memory, but the details are sketchy. With this talent, you automatically succeed at these &quot;memory rolls,&quot; and you often recall precise details. 

{{Indent}}This trait affects recall, not comprehension, and so does not benefit skills. However, it gives a bonus whenever the GM requires an IQ roll for learning: +5 for Eidetic Memory, +10 for Photographic Memory.

{{Indent}}This trait comes in two levels:

{{Indent}}Eidetic Memory: You automatically remember the general sense of everything you concentrate on, and can recall specific details by making an IQ roll. It is possible to &quot;learn&quot; this advantage in play (bards and skalds often acquire it to recall poems and songs). 5 points.

{{Indent}}Photographic Memory: As above, but you automatically recall specific details, too. Any time you, the player forget a detail your character has seen or heard, the GM or other players must remind you - truthfully! 10 points.
