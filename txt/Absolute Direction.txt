You have an excellent sense of
direction. This ability comes in two
levels:

''Absolute Direction:'' You always
know which way is north, and you can
always retrace a path you have
followed within the past month, no
matter how faint or confusing. This
ability does not work in environments
such as interstellar space or the limbo
of the astral plane, but it does work
underground, underwater, and on
other planets. This gives +3 to Body
Sense and Navigation (Air, Land, or
Sea). (Note: The navigational sense
that guides migratory creatures to
their destination is too crude to qualify;
treat it as a 0-point feature.) ''5 points.''

''3D Spatial Sense:'' As above, but
works in three dimensions. This ability
is useful in deep space – although it
does not help you if you travel across
dimensions. You get the skill bonuses
given for Absolute Direction, plus +1
to Piloting and +2 to Aerobatics, Free
Fall, and Navigation (Hyperspace or
Space). ''10 points.''
