|{{Indent}}You go through periods where falling asleep is very difficult. During such an episode, you must make a HT- 1 roll once per night. On a success, you fall asleep easily, ending that episode of insomnia. On a failure, you lose two hours of sleep that night (and suffer all the usual effects; see Missed Sleep, p. 426) and the episode continues for another night. On a critical failure, you get no sleep that night. Point value depends on severity:

{{Indent}}Mild: The GM secretly rolls 3d for the number of days between episodes. -10 points.

{{Indent}}Severe: The GM rolls 2d-1 for the number of days between episodes. -15 points.

{{Indent}}Regardless of severity, whenever you suffer prolonged stress, the GM can require a HT roll. Failure means an episode starts immediately.
