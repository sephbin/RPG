|{{Indent}}Something about you makes people pity you and want to take care of you. You get +3 on all reaction rolls from those who consider you to be in a position of helplessness, weakness, or need (which never includes those with the Callous disadvantage). Taken in conjunction with above-average looks, Pitiable means you are “cute” instead of “sexy”; in combination with below-average looks, it means you are “appealingly homely,” like a basset hound.
