|{{Indent}}You negate magical energy (&quot;mana&quot;) in your vicinity, making it difficult or impossible for others to cast spells. You can never cast spells yourself, nor can you have any level of Magery.

{{Indent}}Each level of Mana Damper (to a maximum of three) reduces the local mana level by one step, but only for you and people or things that you're carrying. For instance, a wizard could throw a fireball at you unhindered, but he would find it difficult to use magic to turn you to stone or read your mind. For details, see Mana (p. 235).

&lt;font size=&quot;3&quot;&gt;'''Special Enhancements'''&lt;/font&gt;

{{Indent}}Area Effect: Your ability affects everything in an area centered on you. The first level of Area Effect gives you a radius of one yard. Each level after the first doubles this radius as usual; see Area Effect (p. 102). +50%/level.

{{Indent}}Switchable: You can switch this power off - for instance, to let a friendly wizard affect you or operate within your area of effect. +100%.

{{Indent}}Discriminatory: You and any allies in your area of effect enjoy the best mana level your ability can provide - highest if casting spells, lowest if resisting them - while enemies in the area suffer the worst level you can generate. This modifier includes Switchable, and replaces the Selective Area enhancement for Mana Damper and Mana Enhancer. +150%.
