|{{Indent}}You are magically adept. This advantage comes in levels. You must purchase Magery 0 before buying higher levels of Magery.

{{Indent}}Magery 0: This is basic &quot;magical awareness,&quot; a prerequisite for learning magic in most worlds. The GM makes a Sense roll (p. 358) when you first see a magic item, and again when you first touch it. On a success, you intuitively know that the item is magical. A roll of 3 or 4 also tells you whether the magic is helpful or dangerous, and about how strong it is. Those without Magery do not get this roll! 5 points.

{{Indent}}Magery 1+: Higher levels of Magery make it much easier to learn and use magic. Add your Magery to IQ when you learn spells. For instance, if you have IQ 14, Magery 3 lets you learn spells as if you had IQ 17. Add your Magery level to Perception when you roll to sense magic items, and to IQ when you learn Thaumatology skill (p. 225).

{{Indent}}Reduce the time required to learn new spells in play (but not the point cost) by 10% per Magery level, to a minimum of 60% of the usual time at Magery 4. For instance, with Magery 3, you would learn spells in 70% the usual time.

{{Indent}}Powerful spells require a minimum level of Magery as a prerequisite, so be sure to skim the Spell List (pp. 242- 253) when deciding how much Magery you need. Note that high Magery lets you produce powerful results with even the most basic spells; see Magery and Effect (p. 237). The GM sets the maximum Magery allowed to PCs. Magery 3 is about right for &quot;classic fantasy.&quot; 10 points/level (on top of the 5 points for Magery 0).

{{Indent}}&lt;font size=&quot;3&quot;&gt;'''Mages in Nonmagical Settings'''&lt;/font&gt;

{{Indent}}The use of Magery becomes tricky in nonmagical backgrounds. You still have the ability to sense magic, but until you gain experience with magic, the GM should not say, &quot;That idol is magical,&quot; but, &quot;That idol looks very strange to you, very sinister. You sense there is something special about it.&quot; If you are from a nonmagical culture, you do not start with any spells, but you can still learn magic if you find an opportunity. When you enter a magical world, those who can detect your aura recognize you as a potential magic-user. How they react depends on the setting.

{{Indent}}Magery 0 costs 5 points for all mages, but you may apply one of the limitations below to the 10 points/level for Magery 1+. Limited Magery is sometimes known as &quot;aspected Magery.&quot;

&lt;font size=&quot;3&quot;&gt;'''Special Limitations'''&lt;/font&gt;

{{Indent}}Dance: You must be free to use bodily motions in order to cast spells. You are not freed from rituals requiring movement as your spell level increases (see Magic Rituals, p. 237). However, you need not speak at all to cast your spells. -40%.

{{Indent}}Dark-Aspected: You can only use your powers in darkness. Regardless of the time of day or night, any light greater than candlelight or starlight deprives you of your abilities, though your aura reveals that you are a mage. -50%.

{{Indent}}Day-Aspected: You can use your powers only when the sun is in the sky - on average, from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. During solar eclipses, you have no powers! The effects of other astronomical events are up to the GM. When the sun is down, you have none of your magical abilities, although a look at your aura reveals that you are a mage. You are not affected by being in buildings, underground, and so on; only the sun's position matters. You know automatically (if you are awake) when it is one minute to sunrise and one minute to sunset. -40%.

{{Indent}}Musical: You must use a musical instrument in order to cast spells. You can never cast spells silently. -50%.

{{Indent}}Night-Aspected: You can only use your powers when the sun is not in the sky - on average, from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. When the sun is up, you have none of your magical abilities, although a look at your aura reveals that you are a mage. You are not affected by being in buildings, underground, and so on; only the sun's position matters. You know automatically (if you are awake) when it is one minute to sunrise and one minute to sunset. -40%.

{{Indent}}One College Only: Your Magery only benefits the spells of a single college and the Recover Energy spell (p. 248). You learn other spells as though you were a nonmage, and can only cast them in high-mana areas. You may still count such spells as prerequisites for spells in your own college. You cannot detect magic items unless they contain at least one spell of your college, in which case you roll normally for detection on first sight and first touch. -40%.

{{Indent}}Solitary: Your magical abilities are at -3 for every sapient being within five yards of you, and -6 for anyone touching you. As partial compensation, you get a roll vs. IQ to notice any time a sapient creature enters or leaves the five-yard area around you - but this only works on a single person. If there is already someone standing next to you, you won't notice if someone else approaches. -40%.

{{Indent}}Song: You must be able to sing in order to cast your spells. You are not freed from the ritual of speaking to cast spells as your spell level increases (see Magic Rituals, p. 237). -40%.
