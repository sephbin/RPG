You can’t depend on it, but sometimes
you get this prickly feeling right
at the back of your neck, and you
know something’s wrong . . . If you
have Danger Sense, the GM rolls
once against your Perception, secretly,
in any situation involving an
ambush, impending disaster, or similar
hazard. On a success, you get
enough of a warning that you can
take action. A roll of 3 or 4 means you
get a little detail as to the nature of
the danger.

Danger Sense is included in
Precognition (p. 77); if you have the
latter trait, you cannot also have
Danger Sense.
