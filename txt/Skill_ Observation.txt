|{{Indent}}This is the talent of observing dangerous or &quot;interesting&quot; situations without letting others know that you are watching. Use this skill to monitor a location, a group of people, or your immediate surroundings for concealed or tactically significant details. This is not the same as gathering clues or making a hands-on search (use Forensics and Search, respectively) - you always use Observation from a distance

{{Indent}}A successful skill roll lets you gather information that is not specifically hidden. For instance, you could case a bank for obvious cameras before a robbery, learn the schedule of sentries, estimate the size of a crowd, or gauge the strength of troops moving in the open. The GM may require an Intelligence Analysis roll to interpret what you observe

{{Indent}}To spot deliberately hidden details - e.g., someone trying to sneak up on you, an armed man hiding in the crowd, or a concealed machine-gun nest - you must win a Quick Contest of Observation skill vs. the Stealth, Shadowing, or Camouflage skill (as appropriate) of the other party. The GM should roll the Contest in secret, and should not say, &quot;You don't see the machine gun nest concealed in the bushes.&quot;

{{Indent}}If your attempt fails, you get no details on an obvious item, or fail to spot a hidden one. On a critical failure, someone spots you and reacts poorly to the attention . . 

{{Indent}}&lt;font color=&quot;#006AFF&quot; size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Modifiers: Acute Senses (p. 35), as appropriate; modifiers for cover, darkness, or size; -1 to -10 if the target is concealed by high-tech camouflage or &quot;stealth&quot; technology; +1 to +10 if you possess suitable surveillance devices (a thermograph to spot a concealed sniper, binoculars to observe troop movements, etc.) and succeed at the skill roll to operate them.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;
