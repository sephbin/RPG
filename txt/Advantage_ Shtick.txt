|{{Indent}}You have a cool move or slick feature that sets you apart from the masses. This provides no combat or reaction bonuses, and you can’t use it to earn money, but it might occasionally give you some minor benefit in play (GM’s discretion). Example: your clothing is always spotless, even after combat or swimming the Nile; you can run, climb, fight, etc. while wearing high heels without suffering any special penalty for bad footing.
