|{{Indent}}This is the art of effective begging: who to approach, how to approach them, and how to avoid legal entanglements. Roll once per hour of begging

{{Indent}}On a success, you net $2.00 times your margin of success. On a critical success, you get some sort of unexpected bonus - perhaps someone buys you dinner or gives you a useful or saleable item (e.g., a raincoat or a new pair of shoes). On a failure, you receive nothing. On a critical failure, you are assaulted or have a run-in with the law

{{Indent}}&lt;font color=&quot;#006AFF&quot; size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Modifiers: Any bonus for Charisma (p. 41); +3 for Pitiable (p. 22); -1 to -4 for Shyness (p. 154). You may, if you wish, apply the opposite of your usual appearance modifier - that is, a penalty for being attractive or a bonus for being unattractive - unless you are Horrific or Monstrous (p. 21). The GM may assign a bonus if there is a lot of foot traffic in the area, or a penalty if there is no one around.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;
