|{{Indent}}You can &quot;infect&quot; others with a supernatural condition - vampirism, lycanthropy, etc. - and exert absolute control over them. This trait is only appropriate for supernatural beings that spread their &quot;curse&quot; through infection, and only affects members of susceptible races (typically your original race and very similar races). The GM is the judge of which curses are spread this way and who is susceptible.

{{Indent}}When you buy Dominance, you must specify one natural attack - Claws, Innate Attack, Vampiric Bite, etc. - that delivers the infection. Anyone you damage this way must roll 3d vs. the HP of injury he received (maximum one roll per day). If he rolls under the damage amount, he becomes infected, and will change into the same kind of creature as you in 2d days, or at the GM's discretion, without suitable supernatural intervention. The GM is free to impose additional conditions for infection; for instance, the victim might have to suffer three attacks, or share your blood, or even die before making the roll above.

{{Indent}}Once the transition is complete, the victim acquires your supernatural racial template (Vampire, Werewolf, etc.) plus Slave Mentality (p. 154). He becomes your subordinate. If he goes on to infect others, his victims will acquire the same traits and serve you as well.

{{Indent}}Dominance itself costs 20 points, but to control a new victim, you must have sufficient unspent points to buy him as an Ally (p. 36) with the enhancements &quot;Minion&quot; (due to his Slave Mentality) and &quot;Special Abilities&quot; (because he can create new servitors for you). You can choose any frequency of appearance, and may improve this later on with earned points. If you lack the points to buy you victim as an Ally - even at a frequency of &quot;6 or less&quot; - he will still be infected but he will not become your slave.

{{Indent}}Dominance persists until you die (truly die, for undead), or your slave grows in power and you cannot (or choose not to) spend the points to keep him as an Ally, or the GM rules the curse is broken via supernatural means. If any of these things occur, your victim will lose Slave Mentality and become free-willed. You may use the points spent on your former Ally to dominate new victims.

{{Indent}}See Infectious Attack (p. 140) for the disadvantageous form of Dominance.
