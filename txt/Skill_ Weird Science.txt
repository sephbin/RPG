|{{Indent}}This skill allows you to formulate astonishing new crackpot scientific theories that are far ahead of their time . . . or at least utterly different from the usual assumptions of your tech level. You may attempt a Weird Science roll whenever you work on a new invention (see Chapter 17) or investigate an existing item of weird technology (e.g., a UFO)

{{Indent}}On a success, you get +5 on an invention attempt (but only +1 if using the Gadgeteer advantage, since Gadgeteer already gives you favorable die rolls for thinking &quot;outside the box&quot;). If investigating weird technology, success gives +2 to any skill roll you make for this purpose - and the GM might even allow a default skill roll to operate the device!

{{Indent}}On a critical success, you get these bonuses and some incredible insight into a totally different problem! Critical failures are always spectacular, although not necessarily fatal or even dangerous
