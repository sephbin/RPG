|{{Indent}}You dislike &quot;yucky stuff&quot;: little bugs and crawly things, blood and dead bodies, slime, etc. When exposed to such things, you react just as if you had a Phobia; see Phobias, p. 148. Note that you do not suffer from the standard fears of insects, reptiles, dirt, and the dead! What bothers you isn't huge bugs or reptiles, ordinary &quot;clean&quot; dirt, and ghosts; it's nasty creepy things, filth, and bits of grue.
