Every character has a temperature
“comfort zone” within which he suffers
no ill effects (such as FP or HP
loss) due to heat or cold. For ordinary
humans, this zone is 55° wide and falls
between 35° and 90°. For nonhumans,
the zone can be centered anywhere,
but this is a 0-point feature for a zone
no larger than 55°. A larger zone is an
advantage. Each level of Temperature
Tolerance adds HT degrees to your
comfort zone, distributed in any way
you wish between the “cold” and “hot”
ends of the zone.

Temperature Tolerance confers no
special resistance to attacks by fire or
ice unless the only damage is a result
of a rise or fall in the ambient temperature.
In particular, it cannot help you
if your body temperature is being
manipulated.

In a realistic campaign, the GM
should limit normal humans to
Temperature Tolerance 1 or 2.
However, high levels of this trait are
likely for nonhumans with fur or a
heavy layer of fat.
