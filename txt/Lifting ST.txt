You have lifting capacity out of proportion
to your mass. This is common
for vehicles and supers. Add your
Lifting ST to your ordinary ST when
you determine Basic Lift (p. 15) for the
purposes of carrying, lifting, pushing,
and pulling. Lifting ST also adds to ST
in situations where you can apply slow,
steady pressure (grappling, choking,
etc.). Lifting ST does not boost ST (or
Basic Lift) for the purpose of determining
HP, throwing distance, or damage
inflicted by melee attacks or
thrown weapons.

If you bought your ST with the Size
limitation, apply the same limitation
to Lifting ST. The No Fine
Manipulators limitation does not give
a discount, however.
