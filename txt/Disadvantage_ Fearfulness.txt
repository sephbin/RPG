|{{Indent}}You are nervous and timid.

{{Indent}}Subtract your Fearfulness from your Will whenever you make a Fright Check, and whenever you must resist the Intimidation skill (p. 202) or a supernatural power that causes fear. As well, add your Fearfulness level to all Intimidation rolls made against you.

{{Indent}}You may not reduce your Will roll below 3. For instance, if you have Will 11, you are limited to Fearfulness 8.

{{Indent}}This trait is the opposite of Fearlessness (p. 55); you cannot have both.
