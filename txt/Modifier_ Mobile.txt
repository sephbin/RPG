|{{Indent}}You may only add this enhancement to an attack that has both Area Effect (p. 102) and Persistent (below). The area of effect moves under your control. Move equals the level of the enhancement (Move 1 at +40%, Move 2 at +80%, and so on), and cannot exceed the attack's Max range.

{{Indent}}To move the area of effect, you must take a Concentrate maneuver. To make the mobile area autonomous, add Homing (which causes it to attack the nearest valid target) and possibly Selective Area (so it only seeks out enemies). Buy these enhancements twice if they're intended to apply to both the initial attack roll and the autonomous area.

{{Indent}}Mobile is mutually exclusive with Drifting (p. 105).
