Nodes
Asherin is dotted with large sources of mineral deposits that create forces similar to magnetism. Eorith is not spherical, and does not have magnetic poles for compasses to work. The stars are unreliable to travel by, as they flow through the sky never once has a constelation repeated. The inhabitants of eorith have discovered the minerals associated with each particular node can be use similar to compasses, but instead reveal where you are relative to a note. These are called Node Compasses, and vary in size and price. The basic compass is attuned to one node, and tells you which direction the node can be found. Normally these come as flat discs with the needle locked into one diretion of rotation. These are cheap and barely used by professionals. The upgrade from the single node compass is the dual node compass. It cost is significantly more than a single node compass, as contains two needles within disc. Each needle is attuned to a seperate node, relatively close to each other in proximity. These compasses not only allow people to locate themselves to each node, but allows for simple triangulation. This means owners of a dual node compass have a fairly good idea about where they are. The third type, the trinode compass, is a triple needle compass that is not mounted on a disc. Instead each needle is placed within a sphere on a common axis. Each needle can rotate in 3 dimensions allowing the user to locate themselves on a map, and compte roughly their altitude. Only the richest, or ambitious travelers have these compasses, and they regularly come with needle kits, so the compass can be attuned to new nodes when neccessary.
