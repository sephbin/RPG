Combat: Do Nothing
[[Category:GURPS Combat]]
Anyone who is just standing still is assumed to be doing nothing. In particular, when combat begins, anyone who has not yet taken a turn is treated as if he took this maneuver before entering combat.

Someone who is conscious but stunned or surprised must take this maneuver. On each turn of Do Nothing, he may attempt a HT roll to recover from physical stun or an IQ roll to recover from mental stun. On a success, he recovers at the end of his turn – that is, he Does Nothing this turn, but may act normally next turn.


Movement: None!

Active Defense: Any (unless you’re tied up, etc.). If you are stunned, however, your active defenses are at -4 until your next turn – even if you recover.
