|{{Indent}}You have an unusual rapport with growing things. On encountering a plant, the GM will roll against your IQ. On a success, he will give you a general sense of its health and whether it is natural or supernatural in origin. Furthermore, this advantage functions as Empathy (p. 51) with respect to sentient plants, and allows you to use your Influence skills (see p. 359) on such entities, which will usually ensure a positive reaction.

{{Indent}}This ability frequently accompanies some level of Green Thumb (see Talent, p. 89) and often Sense of Duty (Plants) or Vow (Use plant material only if gathered without severe injury to the plant).
