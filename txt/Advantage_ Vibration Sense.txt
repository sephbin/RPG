|{{Indent}}You can detect the location and size of objects by sensing vibrations with your skin, whiskers, or antennae. You must specify whether this ability works in the air or in the water.

{{Indent}}Vibration Sense is not a substitute for vision. You can locate an opponent in the dark, but you cannot detect details (e.g., whether he is armed). In a perfectly still, dark chamber, you would have only a vague notion of the size of the area, but you would be able to sense a barrier before you ran into it, and could find openings by sensing the flow of air or water.

{{Indent}}To use Vibration Sense, make a Sense roll. Consult the Size and Speed/Range Table (p. 550) and apply separate bonuses for the target's size and speed, and a penalty for the range to the target. Wind (in air) or swift currents (in water) will generate &quot;noise&quot; that interferes with your sense. Find the speed of the wind or current on the table and assess the relevant speed penalty.

{{Indent}}A successful roll reveals the rough size, location, speed, and direction of movement of the target. It does not provide any information about the object's shape, color, etc. Once you have detected something, you may target it with an attack. The modifiers that applied to your Sense roll also apply to your attack roll, but can never give you a bonus to hit.

{{Indent}}Note that if you are outside the element (air or water) where your ability functions, or if you are wearing a sealed suit, this ability does not work at all!

{{Indent}}Universal: Your Vibration Sense works both in the air and in the water. +50%.

{{Indent}}Sense of Perception: Your ability doesn't depend on air or water currents tickling hairs or your skin. You detect vibrations by virtue of a &quot;sixth sense&quot; (e.g., psychokinetic feedback). This works even when you're in a sealed suit or a vacuum, and isn't subject to interference by environmental noise. This gives all the benefits of Universal; there's no need to take both enhancements. +100%.

{{Indent}}Targeting: By taking an Aim maneuver, you can &quot;lock onto&quot; anything you've already detected and determine its precise range and speed, exactly as if you had a technological rangefinder. This gives you +3 to hit that target with an aimed ranged attack. +20%.
