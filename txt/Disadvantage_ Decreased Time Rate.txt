|{{Indent}}This is the disadvantageous counterpart to Altered Time Rate (p. 38). You experience time half as fast as normal: one subjective second for every two real seconds that pass. You only get a turn every two seconds in combat! (Gaming groups that enjoy extra detail might wish to give characters with Decreased Time Rate &quot;halfturns&quot; instead: splitting a Move maneuver across two turns, declaring an Attack maneuver one turn and rolling to hit the next, etc.)
