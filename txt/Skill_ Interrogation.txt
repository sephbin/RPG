|{{Indent}}This is the ability to question a prisoner. Only intelligence agencies, police and prison services, the military, and the underworld teach this skill

{{Indent}}Roll a Quick Contest of Interrogation vs. the prisoner's Will for each question. This requires 5 minutes per question. If you win, you get a truthful answer. If you tie or lose, the victim remains silent or lies. If you lose by more than five points, he tells you a good, believable lie! The GM roleplays the prisoner (or, if you are the prisoner, the GM will roleplay the interrogator) and makes all die rolls in secret

{{Indent}}&lt;font color=&quot;#006AFF&quot; size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Modifiers: -5 if the prisoner's loyalty to his leader or cause is &quot;Very Good&quot; or &quot;Excellent&quot;; -3 for Low Empathy (p. 142); +2 for a lengthy interrogation (over two hours); +3 if you use severe threats; +6 if you use torture*. Increase these last two bonuses by +1 if you have the Callous disadvantage (p. 125)!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;

{{Indent}}* &quot;Torture&quot; does not necessarily mean thumbscrews and the rack. Exposing a prisoner to the object of his phobia (see Phobias, p. 148) is an effective torture, as is a believable threat against a loved one. Note that torturing a prisoner is usually considered vile behavior, likely bringing retribution
