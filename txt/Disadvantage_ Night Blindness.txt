|{{Indent}}You have poor night vision. If the vision or combat penalty for poor lighting is between -1 and -4 for most people, your penalty is the worse of double the usual penalty or -3. If the usual penalty is -5 or worse, you function as though you were completely blind (see Blindness, p. 124). If you have Acute Vision (p. 35), it only applies in situations with no darkness penalty.

{{Indent}}This trait is mutually exclusive with both Night Vision (p. 71) and Dark Vision (p. 47).
