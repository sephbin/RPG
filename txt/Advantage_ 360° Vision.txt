|-
|{{Indent}}You have a 360° field of vision. You have no penalty to defend against attacks from the sides or rear. You can attack foes to your sides or rear without making a Wild Swing, but you are at -2 to hit due to the clumsy angle of attack (note that some Karate techniques do not suffer this penalty). Finally, you are at +5 to detect Shadowing attempts, and are never surprised by a danger that comes from behind, unless it also is concealed from sight.

{{Indent}}Extra eyes are merely a special effect of this trait - you can have any number of eyes, but the point cost remains the same.

&lt;font size=&quot;3&quot;&gt;'''Special Enhancements'''&lt;/font&gt;

{{Indent}}Panoptic 1: You can see all around you without turning your head and without the need for extra eyes. This is an enhancement because your gift isn't obvious - you can visibly stare in one direction and actually be looking in another! You still need eyes, though. If you're blindfolded, dazzled, blinded by injuries, etc., you cannot see. +20%.

{{Indent}}Panoptic 2: As above, but you don't need eyes. You can always perceive everything going on around you, even if blinded or blindfolded. You still need light, unless you have something like Dark Vision. Blows to the eyes injure you normally but won't blind this sense. +60%.

&lt;font size=&quot;3&quot;&gt;'''Special Limitations'''&lt;/font&gt;

{{Indent}}Easy to Hit: Your eyes are on stalks, unusually large, or otherwise more vulnerable to attack. Others can target your eyes from within their arc of vision at only -6 to hit. -20%.
