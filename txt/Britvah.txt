'''Cold weather outfit''' +5 Fort save vs. cold weather.&lt;br/&gt;
'''Combat Expertise +/-4''' Bonus to AC in exchange for an equal penalty to attack.&lt;br/&gt;
'''Deadly Surprise (Ex)''' When you hit an opponent that is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC, you may attempt a dirty trick combat maneuver as part of the attack.&lt;br/&gt;
'''Enhanced Mobility (Ex)''' +4 AC vs attacks of opportunity while moving out of a threatened square.&lt;br/&gt;

'''Greater Dirty Trick''' Dirty Trick penalty lasts 1d4 rds, +1 per 5 over CMD and takes a standard action to remove.&lt;br/&gt;
'''Greater Disarm''' When disarming a foe, their weapon lands 15 ft away in a random direction.&lt;br/&gt;
'''Ice skates''' Can move on ice at normal speed with a DC 5 Acrobatics check.&lt;br/&gt;
'''Immovable rod''' This rod is a flat iron bar with a small button on one end. When the button is pushed (a move action), the rod does not move from where it is, even if staying in place defies gravity. Thus, the owner can lift or place the rod wherever he wishes, push the button, and let go. Several immovable rods can even make a ladder when used together (although only two are needed). An immovable rod can support up to 8,000 pounds before falling to the ground. If a creature pushes against an immovable rod, it must make a DC 30 Strength check to move the rod up to 10 feet in a single round.
