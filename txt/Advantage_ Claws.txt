|{{Indent}}You have claws. This advantage modifies all your hands and feet; there is no discount for claws on only some of your limbs. There are several variations:

{{Indent}}Blunt Claws: Very short claws, like those of a dog. Add +1 per die to the damage you inflict with a punch or kick; e.g., 2d-3 becomes 2d-1. 3 points.

{{Indent}}Hooves: Hard hooves, like those of a horse. Add +1 per die to the damage you inflict with a kick, and give your feet (only) +1 DR. 3 points.

{{Indent}}Sharp Claws: Short claws, like those of a cat. Change the damage you inflict with a punch or kick from crushing to cutting. 5 points.

{{Indent}}Talons: Longer claws - up to 12&quot; long. Change the damage you inflict with a punch or kick from crushing to your choice of cutting or impaling (choose before you roll to hit). 8 points.

{{Indent}}Long Talons: Huge claws, like sword blades extending from your body! Treat these as Talons, but damage is +1 per die. 11 points.
