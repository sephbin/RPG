|{{Indent}}Your rate of time perception is faster than that of a normal human. The first level of this advantage lets you experience time twice as fast as a normal - that is, you experience two subjective seconds for each real second that passes. Each level past the first increases this ratio by one: three times as fast at level 2, four times as fast at level 3, and so on.

{{Indent}}Each level of Altered Time Rate lets you take one additional maneuver on your turn in combat, allowing you to cast spells quickly by taking multiple Concentrate maneuvers, run very fast by taking multiple Move maneuvers, etc. Your turn doesn't come any sooner, however! This advantage affects how fast you move when you react, but not how quickly you react in the first place.

{{Indent}}Out of combat, Altered Time Rate allows you the luxury of extensive planning, even in crisis situations, as everything seems to happen in slow motion. You may always attempt a Sense roll, or an IQ-based skill roll to make plans or recall information (GM's decision), at no penalty to additional actions.

{{Indent}}Super-Speed: You're even faster out of combat! When performing mundane or repetitive tasks - building things (including new inventions), reading, making repairs, etc. - look up your ATR level in the Size column of the Size and Speed/Range Table (p. B550) and divide the time required by the number in the Linear Measurement column. For example, ATR 6 gives a divisor of 20, which means a repair that normally requires an hour takes you just three minutes. You can reduce time further by taking a skill penalty (see p. B346). You can't hasten learning, special abilities (making magic items, concentrating on Mind Control, etc.), Concept rolls when inventing, or interactions with people or machines incapable of matching your speed. The GM may wish restrict Super-Speed to superheroic speedsters. +20%.

&lt;font size=&quot;3&quot;&gt;'''Special Limitations'''&lt;/font&gt;

{{Indent}}Non-Combat Speed: You enjoy the benefits of Super-Speed out of combat, but get no additional maneuvers in combat. You can buy some of your ATR with Super-Speed and the rest with this limitation. -60%.
