|{{Indent}}You can communicate empathically with plants. All earthly plants are IQ 0, but a large tree might be &quot;wiser&quot; than the average ivy, at the GM's whim. A plant might know how recently it was watered or walked on, or something else that directly bears on its well-being, but would be unable to relate an overheard phone conversation. Any normal plant will always cooperate, within the limits of its ability.

{{Indent}}Sapience: The plants you converse with function as if they had your IQ, as described for the enhancement of the same name under Speak With Animals (above). +40%.

{{Indent}}Specialized: You can only communicate with certain plants. &quot;All terrestrial plants&quot; (including all trees, bushes, and herbs) and &quot;All aquatic plants&quot; (including algae, kelp, and seaweed) are -40%; a large subset of either (e.g., &quot;Trees&quot; or &quot;Herbs&quot;), -50%; a smaller subset (e.g., &quot;Evergreens&quot; or &quot;Medicinal Herbs&quot;), -60%.
