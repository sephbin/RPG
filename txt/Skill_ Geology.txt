|{{Indent}}This is the science dealing with the structure of planets - their crust, mantle, and core. A geologist knows about minerals, oil, ores, etc.; about earthquakes and volcanoes; and about fossils. In the field, he can attempt to find water by using an &quot;eye for country&quot; (see Survival, p. 223)

{{Indent}}You must specialize by planet type. See Planet Types (p. 180) for details
