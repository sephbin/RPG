|{{Indent}}This is the ability to interpret a person's facial expressions and body posture in order to gauge his feelings. You can use it like the Empathy advantage (p. 51) or Detect Lies skill (p. 187), but only on a subject you can see. You can also use it to get a rough idea of what a party member is doing or about to do in a situation where he cannot communicate with you directly (for instance, when using Stealth). You can only observe one subject at a time

{{Indent}}The ability to read body language in combat is a standard part of any Melee Weapon or unarmed combat skill; see Feint (p. 365)

{{Indent}}&lt;font color=&quot;#006AFF&quot; size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Modifiers: All Vision modifiers; physiology modifiers (see box); +4 if your subject is Easy to Read (p. 134). Anything that makes the subject harder to &quot;read&quot; gives a penalty: baggy clothing gives -1, a shield or a voluminous cloak gives from -2 to -4, and a mask gives -5 (and makes it impossible to use this skill if you cannot see the rest of the body!).&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;
