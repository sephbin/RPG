|{{Indent}}You are hard to knock out. Each level of Hard to Subdue gives +1 to any HT roll to avoid unconsciousness - whether as a result of injury, drugs, or ultra-tech weapons - and to resist supernatural abilities that cause unconsciousness. In a realistic campaign, the GM may wish to limit characters to Hard to Subdue 1 or 2.
