|{{Indent}}You can use two or more advantages simultaneously, as if they were a single ability. For +10%, your abilities are permanently linked into a single power, and must be used together - you cannot use them separately. For +20%, you can also use them separately. You must add this enhancement to all the abilities you wish to link.

{{Indent}}If you link two attacks into one and give them identical Malf., 1/2D, Max, Acc, RoF, Shots, and Recoil, you can treat them as a single attack with one attack roll but separate rolls for damage. This is not the same as the Follow-Up enhancement (p. 105)!
