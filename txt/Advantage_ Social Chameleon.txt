|{{Indent}}You have the knack of knowing exactly what to say - and when to say it - around your social &quot;betters.&quot; You are exempt from reaction penalties due to differences in Rank or Status. In situations where there would be no such penalty, you get +1 on reactions from those who demand respect (priests, kings, etc.). This is a cinematic advantage!
