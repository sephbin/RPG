You can really move! Each level of
Enhanced Move doubles your top
speed in one environment: Air,
Ground, Space, or Water. You may
also take a half-level of Enhanced
Move, either alone or with any whole
number of levels; this costs 10 points
and multiplies Move by 1.5.


''Example 1: A super buys Enhanced Move 4 (Ground), for 80 points. He multiplies his Move by 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 = 16. If his Basic Move were 8, he could run at 128 yards/second (262 mph).''

''Example 2: An avian race has Enhanced Move 2.5 (Air), for 50 points. All members of the race multiply their top airspeed by 2 x 2 x 1.5 = 6.''


Your multiplied Move is your top
speed. Record it in parentheses after
your Enhanced Move trait; for
instance, the super in the example
above would write “Enhanced Move 4
(Ground Speed 128).” You can always
choose to accept a slightly lower top
speed if you want your speed to match
that of a real-world or fictional creature
or vehicle with a known top
speed. This does not give you back any
points.

Enhanced Move does not affect
Basic Speed, Basic Move, or Dodge.
Its benefits apply only when moving
along a relatively straight, smooth
course (see Sprinting, p. 354). It does
have some defensive value, however:
those who attack you with ranged
attacks must take your speed into
account when calculating speed/range
modifiers (see p. 550).

Most forms of Enhanced Move
have prerequisites. Enhanced Move
(Water) requires Amphibious (p. 40)
or Aquatic (p. 145). Enhanced Move
(Air) requires Flight (p. 56). Enhanced
Move (Space) requires Flight with the
Space Flight or Newtonian Space
Flight enhancement, and affects
movement in space – not airspeed. To
move faster in air and in space, buy
both Enhanced Move (Air) and
Enhanced Move (Space).
