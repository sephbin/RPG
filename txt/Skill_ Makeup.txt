|{{Indent}}This is the skill of using theatrical makeup to enhance a performer's appearance. It is not just the ability to make someone look &quot;pretty&quot; - you can make yourself or others look older, younger, or of a different race or nationality. At TL6+, you can use prosthetics to further enhance the effect. However, you cannot make someone look taller or shorter than he actually is
