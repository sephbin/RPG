|{{Indent}}This is the study of the recorded past (compare Archaeology skill, p. 176). A successful skill roll lets you answer questions about history, and might (at the GM's option) allow you to remember a useful parallel: &quot;Ah, yes. Hannibal faced a situation like this once, and here's what he did . . .&quot;

{{Indent}}You must specialize. There are two general classes of specialty:

{{Indent}}* A limited geographical region - no larger than a small nation - over multiple eras. &lt;i&gt;Examples:&lt;/i&gt; History (Bavarian), History (Irish), or History (New York State)

{{Indent}}* A single era (e.g., Victorian period, 20th century) and one of a broad geographical region (e.g., Europe), a culture (e.g., Muslim), or an idea (e.g., economic, esoteric, or military). &lt;i&gt;Examples:&lt;/i&gt; History (20th-Century American), History (Ottoman Muslim), or History (Napoleonic Military)

{{Indent}}The sheer variety of possible specialties makes it impossible to list all possible defaults. In general, if two specialties overlap at all, then GM should permit a default at -2 to -4
