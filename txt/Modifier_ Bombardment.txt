|{{Indent}}You may only take this limitation in conjunction with Area Effect (p. 102) or Cone (p. 103). The attack does not automatically hit everyone in the area. Instead, it attacks each potential target in the area at an effective skill, which sets the value of the limitation.

{{Indent}}Modify effective skill for target size only - not for range or for any other factor. Determine hit location randomly. If the target is under cover, the cover protects normally against the damage.

{{Indent}}This limitation is intended for attacks like electrical or ice storms, which could affect some but not all individuals within a given area.
