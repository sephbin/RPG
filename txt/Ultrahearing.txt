You can hear sounds in the frequencies
above the normal range of
human hearing (20 kHz). This allows
you to hear dog whistles, sonar,
motion detectors, etc. You can detect
active sonar at twice its effective range.
Cost depends on your capabilities:

You can hear only high-frequency
sounds: ''0 points.''

You can hear high-frequency
sounds and other sounds: ''5 points.''


This advantage is included in
Ultrasonic Speech, below; if you have
Ultrasonic Speech, you cannot take
this as well (but donâ€™t need to).
