|{{Indent}}This is the study of the physical, political, and economic divisions of a planet, and how they interact. It is part physical science, part social science. You must specialize:

{{Indent}}&lt;i&gt;Physical:&lt;/i&gt; The study of the physical properties of a planetary surface. A physical geographer could answer questions about climate, terrain, and so forth. You must further specialize by planet type; see Planet Types (p. 180). &lt;i&gt;Defaults:&lt;/i&gt; Geology (same planet type)-4 or Meteorology (same planet type)-4

{{Indent}}&lt;i&gt;Political:&lt;/i&gt; The study of political regions - their borders, natural resources, industries, etc. A political geographer could answer questions about land claims, overpopulation, regional economic disparities, transportation networks, etc. &lt;i&gt;Default:&lt;/i&gt; Economics-4

{{Indent}}&lt;i&gt;Regional:&lt;/i&gt; The study of all of the above, but specific to a single region: New York, the United States, planet Earth, etc. The depth of knowledge decreases with the size of the region (see Area Knowledge, p. 176). &lt;i&gt;Default:&lt;/i&gt; the relevant Area Knowledge skill at -6

{{Indent}}These specialties default among themselves at -5
