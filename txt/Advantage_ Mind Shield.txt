|{{Indent}}You have a &quot;shield&quot; that warns you of and defends against mental attacks. Add your Mind Shield level to IQ or Will whenever you resist an advantage with the Telepathic limitation (see Chapter 6) and whenever you resist a spell listed under Communication and Empathy Spells (p. 245) or Mind Control Spells (p. 250).

{{Indent}}Your shield also resists attempts to locate your mind using magic or psionics. Such abilities must win a Quick Contest against your Will + Mind Shield level to find you.

{{Indent}}You may voluntarily lower your Mind Shield if you wish - for instance, to let a friend read your mind. Lowering or raising your shield is a free action, but it must take place at the start of your turn. Mind Shield does protect you while you are asleep or unconscious, unless you fell asleep or were knocked out while your shield was voluntarily lowered.

&lt;font size=&quot;3&quot;&gt;'''Special Limitations'''&lt;/font&gt;

{{Indent}}Cybernetic: Your shield protects against computer-related attacks - e.g., the &quot;Digital&quot; form of Possession and the &quot;Cybernetic&quot; form of Mind Probe or Mind Reading - instead of magic and psi. This limitation is only available to those with Digital Mind (p. 48). -50%.

{{Indent}}Telepathic: Your ability is part of the Telepathy psi power (see p. 257). -10%.

{{Indent}}Limited: Your Mind Shield only works against certain mental attacks. An entire power source (e.g., divine, magical, psionic, or spirit) is -50%; a specific focus, power, or college of magic (e.g., Telepathy or Mind Control spells) is -75%.
