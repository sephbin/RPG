|{{Indent}}You are abnormally short for your species. Regardless of ST, your height falls below the lowest value on the Build Table – under 4’4,” for a human. This gives you Size Modifier -1. Choose your weight from the first line of the Build Table and reduce it by 15%.

{{Indent}}You have -1 to Basic Move (short legs). In combat, your reach is reduced by 1 yard. This is partly because you have short arms and partly because you must use scaled-down weapons (regardless of your ST, your arms lack the leverage to control fullsized weapons).

{{Indent}}You get -2 to Disguise – or to Shadowing, if your are trying to follow someone in a crowd. In backward settings, the GM may require you to take a Social Stigma if you suffer from Dwarfism.

{{Indent}}A member of any race may be a dwarf. Scale down height by a factor of 0.75 from the racial average, and modify racial SM by -1. Otherwise, the rules remain the same.
