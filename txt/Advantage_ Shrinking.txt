|{{Indent}}You can shrink at will. Each level of Shrinking lets you change your Size Modifier by -1, at the rate of -1 SM per second. You return to normal size at the same rate. By default, you cannot carry any equipment, not even clothing, when you shrink. The ability to carry objects while shrunk is an enhancement.

{{Indent}}When you shrink, find your new height from the Size Modifier Table (p. 19). Every -6 to SM reduces height by a factor of 10. Reduce Move, reach, damage (with unarmed attacks, Innate Attacks, or shrunken weapons), HP, and DR in proportion to height. Every full -2 to SM also reduces weight by a factor of 10; for odd-numbered levels, treat the extra -1 as an additional factor of 3 (e.g., -3 to SM reduces weight by a factor of 30).

{{Indent}}Example: A 5'10&quot;-tall character (SM 0) has Shrinking 12. This lets him shrink until he has SM -12, reducing his height by a factor of 100 (to about 0.7&quot;). However, at that size he has only 1% his usual Move, reach, HP, and DR, and must divide any damage he inflicts by 100. His weight goes down by a factor of 1,000,000!

{{Indent}}Affects Others: You can bring your friends with you when you shrink! &quot;+50% per person you can affect at the same time.

{{Indent}}Can Carry Objects: You may carry objects. This is limited to equipment you are actually carrying or wearing when you shrink. Such items regain normal size when put down; at the GM's option, they might sweep you aside as they grow, or even return to normal size beneath you, stranding you high above the ground! No encumbrance is +10%; Light, +20%; Medium, +50%; Heavy, +100%.

{{Indent}}Full Damage: You inflict full damage when shrunk. (GMs be warned: this makes for an almost perfect assassin.) &quot;+100%.

{{Indent}}Full DR: You retain full DR when shrunk. +30%.

{{Indent}}Full HP: You retain full HP when shrunk. +30%.

{{Indent}}Full Move: You retain full Move when shrunk. +30%.
