|{{Indent}}Your vision extends across the infrared, visible, and ultraviolet portions of the spectrum. This integrated picture often reveals details that are invisible to those who merely possess normal vision, Infravision (p. 60), or Ultravision (p. 94).

{{Indent}}Hyperspectral Vision grants nearperfect night vision: you suffer no vision or combat penalties if there is any light at all. In total darkness, it functions exactly like Infravision. This trait also gives +3 on all Vision rolls; on all rolls to spot hidden clues or objects with Forensics, Observation, or Search skill; and on all Tracking rolls.

{{Indent}}If you possess Hyperspectral Vision, you cannot also have Infravision or Ultravision. This trait is essentially a higher level of both those advantages. Its game effects replace the specific effects of those traits.

{{Indent}}As described, this trait emulates realistic TL7+ sensors. The GM may permit supers to take the two special enhancements below. Neither is appropriate for real-world sensors!

{{Indent}}Extended Low-Band: You perceive radiation below the infrared, allowing you to &quot;see&quot; microwave, radar, and radio sources. This gives no special ability to understand radio signals! &quot;+30%.

{{Indent}}Extended High-Band: You sense radiation above the ultraviolet, allowing you to &quot;see&quot; X-ray and gamma ray sources. +30%.

{{Indent}}Extended (Special): You can perceive and see by non-electromagnetic radiation. This is mainly useful in science- fiction settings that feature weird radiation . . . or in worlds where magic, psi, and the like emit rays of eldritch power. +30% per added class of radiation.
