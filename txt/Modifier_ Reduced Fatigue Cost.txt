|{{Indent}}You may only take this enhancement for abilities that cost FP, and never in conjunction with the special modifier &quot;Usually On.&quot; You can take it any number of times. Each level cuts the cost to use the ability by 1 FP. If you must &quot;maintain&quot; the ability by spending FP on a regular basis, reduce this maintenance cost by a like amount.
