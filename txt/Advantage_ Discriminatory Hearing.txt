|{{Indent}}You have a superhuman ability to distinguish between sounds. You can always identify people by voice, and can recognize individual machines by their &quot;sound signature.&quot; You may memorize a sound by listening to it for at least one minute and making a successful IQ roll. On a failure, you must wait at least one full day before making a repeated attempt.

{{Indent}}You get +4 (in addition to any Acute Hearing bonuses) on any task that utilizes hearing, and receive +4 to Shadowing skill when following a noisy target.

{{Indent}}To simulate the passive sonar used by submarines, add a -30% Accessibility limitation, &quot;Only underwater.&quot;

{{Indent}}Profiling: You possess an extensive mental database of sensory &quot;signatures&quot; that you can quickly compare to new sensory impressions. This doubles the bonus to analyze and recognize targets (but not to sense or track them) to +8. As a side benefit, all attempts to memorize new signatures succeed automatically - there's no need for an IQ roll. +50%.
