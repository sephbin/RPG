|{{Indent}}You have a crippling reading disability. Even simple maps and road signs are beyond you. You start with a written comprehension level of &quot;None&quot; in your native language. This is included in Dyslexia; you get no extra points for it. Furthermore, you may never improve your written comprehension level beyond &quot;None&quot; in any language. For more on language comprehension, see Language (p. 23).

{{Indent}}You can learn &quot;book-learned&quot; skills at normal speed if you have a teacher to substitute for your inability to use texts. Attempts to learn such a skill without a teacher progress at 1/4 speed - if the skill is one you can teach yourself without books. The GM's word is final in all cases. In traditional fantasy settings, magic is a booklearned skill, and Dyslexia prevents you from ever becoming a wizard.

{{Indent}}Note that this is a severe case. Mild dyslexia is not significant in game terms, except possibly as a quirk.
