|{{Indent}}Your brain's pleasure center is burned out or absent. You cannot appreciate the taste of good food, the joy of sex, the savage beauty of combat, and so on. You might not even remember what these pleasures were like! You can &quot;go through the motions,&quot; but you have -3 on all Carousing, Connoisseur, Erotic Art, and Gambling rolls. Others react to you at -1 to -3 in any situation where your lack of appreciation becomes obvious (GM's decision). A bad reaction indicates ridicule from cultured folk, rejection by a lover, etc. - not violence.

{{Indent}}Some ultra-tech societies might use surgery to inflict this state as a form of punishment! If so, you won't plot your revenge . . . because there won't be any pleasure in it.
