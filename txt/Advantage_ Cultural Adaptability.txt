|{{Indent}}You are familiar with a broad spectrum of cultures. When dealing with those cultures, you never suffer the -3 &quot;cultural unfamiliarity&quot; penalty given under Culture (p. 23). This is definitely a cinematic ability! Point cost depends on the scope of your familiarity:

{{Indent}}Cultural Adaptability: You are familiar with all cultures of your race. 10 points.

{{Indent}}Xeno-Adaptability: You are familiar with all cultures in your game world, regardless of race. 20 points.
