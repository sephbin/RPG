|{{Indent}}You have contracted a contagious, antibiotic-resistant bacteria, retrovirus, or similar disease. This is only transmitted by close, unprotected physical contact. Those who know about it react to you at -1 and automatically resist your seduction attempts. The disease isn't fatal - at least not immediately - but may produce physical symptoms (left to the imagination of the player or GM).
