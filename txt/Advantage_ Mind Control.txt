|{{Indent}}You can mentally dominate those you can see or touch. To use this ability, concentrate for one second and then roll a Quick Contest: your IQ vs. your subject's Will.

{{Indent}}Modifiers: Range penalties to the subject (see p. 550); -1 per slave already under your control; +2 if you concentrate for a full minute, or +4 if you concentrate for a full hour.

{{Indent}}If you win, your victim will obey your every command until you free him. In effect, he temporarily gains the Reprogrammable disadvantage (p. 150), with you as his master. Your control persists for as long as you take uninterrupted Concentrate maneuvers. Once you stop, your control lingers for one minute per point by which you won the Quick Contest. (To increase this, add Extended Duration, p. 105.) If you are incapacitated (stunned, knocked out, etc.), or attempt to force the subject to act against his principles (e.g., commit suicide or harm a loved one), roll another Quick Contest. If your victim wins, he breaks free. Roll at the moment of truth - you can march him to the edge of a cliff, but he doesn't roll until he's about to leap.

{{Indent}}If you lose, you cannot attempt to control that subject again for 24 hours, and he feels a sense of mental coercion emanating from you. On a critical failure, you also lose control of anyone else under the influence of this ability!

{{Indent}}Mind Control often has limitations:

{{Indent}}Accessibility (Only on opposite sex), Sense-Based (for hypnotic voices, eyes, scents, etc.), and so on. It may also have attack modifiers, subject to the restrictions that apply to attacks with Malediction (p. 106). Finally, you may apply the Cybernetic and Cybernetic Only modifiers from Mind Reading (see below).

{{Indent}}Cinematic Hypnotism: The controller must lock eyes with his victim and hypnotize him in order to give commands. This calls for Vision- Based (-20%). Suggestion (-40%) is common.

{{Indent}}Drugs: The attacker uses a drug to make his victim suggestible. This requires a bite, kiss, or more intimate contact. Some time after exposure, the subject gets a HT-based resistance roll. Add Based on HT (+20%), Blood Agent (-40%), Independent (+70%), and Onset (1 minute or 1 hour) (-10% or -20%). If anyone can command the subject, add the Puppet limitation (-40%).

{{Indent}}Pheromones: The user exudes an invisible chemical cloud that inspires attraction in those exposed to it. Victims must be within two yards and breathe the gas - this ability doesn't work by touch or sight. The controller can only command one subject per second, at the usual -1 per subject after the first. Add Area Effect 1 (+50%), Emanation (-20%), and Scent-Based (-20%). Accessibility (Only on opposite sex) (-20%) and Emotion Control (-50%) are likely but not required.

{{Indent}}Vibrations: The controller emits vibrations that influence emotions. Add Emotion Control (-50%), with Based on HT (+20%) for inaudible vibrations or Hearing-Based (-20%) for audible sounds (common for fantasy bards and mythic sirens).

&lt;font size=&quot;3&quot;&gt;'''Special Enhancements'''&lt;/font&gt;

{{Indent}}Conditioning: You can reconstruct the subject's psyche and implant suggestions. In effect, you can add or remove any mundane mental disadvantage. Add Delusions for false memories, or Amnesia to wipe memories. Your victim must be under your control, cooperative, and conscious. Roll a second Quick Contest. You are at -1 per full -5 points of disadvantages changed, but you may substitute Brainwashing skill (p. 182) for IQ. Duration in days is equal to your margin of victory. If you win and roll a critical success, the conditioning is permanent! A conditioned subject who is no longer under your direct control imposes no penalty on the use of Mind Control on others. Note that another person with this ability can use it to undo your work. +50%.

{{Indent}}No Memory: Your victims have no memory of anything that occurred while under your control. +10%.

{{Indent}}Independent: Your Mind Control doesn't require ongoing attention. If it works, you're free to do other things. You must still concentrate to initiate control, but you can't claim the +2 or +4 for lengthy concentration. If the victim fails to resist, control persists for one minute per point by which he lost the Quick Contest; you can't maintain it indefinitely by concentrating. These drawbacks are minor next to the benefits. First, only an attempt to force the subject to act against his principles can break control; you're &quot;out of the loop&quot; already, so incapacitating you changes nothing. Second, since your attention isn't divided, each contact is separate from all others; there's no -1 per slave, and critical failure with one victim doesn't free the rest. +70%.

&lt;font size=&quot;3&quot;&gt;'''Special Limitations'''&lt;/font&gt;

{{Indent}}Conditioning Only: You cannot use regular Mind Control - only Conditioning (above). Uncooperative victims must be restrained before you can use your ability. -50%.

{{Indent}}Puppet: Your victims have no initiative while under your control, and temporarily acquire Slave Mentality (p. 154). -40%.

{{Indent}}Telepathic: Your ability is part of the Telepathy psi power (see p. 257). -10%.

{{Indent}}Emotion Control: You can't control the subject's actions, just his feelings. For some guidelines on what's possible, see the Sway Emotions skill (p. B192). Emotion Control is mutually exclusive with Conditioning Only and Suggestion. -50%.

{{Indent}}Suggestion: You can't command the subject to take specific actions - you can only suggest a general course of action. Effects are as for Suggest skill (p. B191). Suggestion is mutually exclusive with Conditioning Only and Emotion Control. -40%.
