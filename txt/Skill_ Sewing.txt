|{{Indent}}This is the ability to work with fabric using the tools of your tech level. A successful skill roll lets you repair damaged clothing (or any other item made of cloth), modify garments (useful when you must wear another person's clothing, perhaps to impersonate him), or create new clothing or costumes from suitable materials

{{Indent}}Make an IQ-based roll to design clothing, at +1 if you have Fashion Sense (p. 21)

{{Indent}}Before TL7, someone knows this skill in almost every household. At TL7+, it is rare for anyone but a professional seamstress or tailor to know Sewing - most people work at default (at +4 for a simple task like reattaching a button) and discard items that they cannot mend

{{Indent}}&lt;font color=&quot;#006AFF&quot; size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Modifiers: Equipment modifiers (p. 345); modifiers for High Manual Dexterity (p. 59) or Ham-Fisted (p. 138).&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;
