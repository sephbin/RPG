|{{Indent}}You can see in absolute darkness using some means other than light, radar, or sonar. You suffer no skill penalties for darkness, no matter what its origin. However, you cannot see colors in the dark.

{{Indent}}Color Vision: You can see colors in the dark. +20%.

{{Indent}}Hypersensory: Your brain builds up a &quot;picture&quot; of your surroundings from the input of your senses of hearing, smell, and touch (temperature differences, vibrations, and even electric fields), and from tiny flashes of light due to chemical reactions, static discharges, and cosmic ray impacts. You're not aware of these things individually, but collectively, they let you see in the dark as if it were daylight, and even spot invisible foes. Each sense you lose - hearing, smell, touch, or vision - gives -2 to Vision rolls (this penalty can't exceed the current darkness penalty). You're only truly blind if you lose all four. You're still limited to the standard human arc of vision unless you have Peripheral Vision or 360Â° Vision. +40%.
