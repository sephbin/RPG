|{{Indent}}This is general talent with the spoken word. A successful skill roll lets you (for instance) give a good political speech, entertain a group around a campfire, incite or calm a riot, or put on a successful &quot;court jester&quot; act. Public Speaking includes skill with debate, oratory, and rhetoric, as well as ability with less formal activities such as &quot;punning&quot; and storytelling. Not all speakers possess talent in all of these areas. You may take an optional specialty (p. 169) to represent this
