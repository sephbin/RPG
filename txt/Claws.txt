You have claws. This advantage
modifies all your hands and feet; there
is no discount for claws on only some
of your limbs. There are several
variations:


''Blunt Claws:'' Very short claws, like
those of a dog. Add +1 per die to the
damage you inflict with a punch or
kick; e.g., 2d-3 becomes 2d-1. ''3 points.''


''Hooves:'' Hard hooves, like those of
a horse. Add +1 per die to the damage
you inflict with a kick, and give your
feet (only) +1 DR. ''3 points.''


''Sharp Claws:'' Short claws, like those
of a cat. Change the damage you inflict
with a punch or kick from crushing to
cutting. ''5 points.''


''Talons:'' Longer claws – up to 12”
long. Change the damage you inflict
with a punch or kick from crushing to
your choice of cutting or impaling
(choose before you roll to hit). ''8 points.''


''Long Talons:'' Huge claws, like
sword blades extending from your
body! Treat these as Talons, but damage
is +1 per die. ''11 points.''
