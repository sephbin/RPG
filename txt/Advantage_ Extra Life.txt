|{{Indent}}You can come back from the dead! No matter how sure your foes were that they killed you, you didn't really die. Work out the details with the GM. Every time you come back from the dead, you use up one Extra Life - remove it from your character sheet and reduce your point total by 25 points. The GM may wish to let players spend earned points to buy Extra Lives in play.

&lt;font size=&quot;3&quot;&gt;'''Special Limitations'''&lt;/font&gt;

{{Indent}}Copy: When you die, you revert to a &quot;backup copy.&quot; To create this copy takes minutes or hours, possibly at a special facility. Details are up to the GM. Make a copy of your character sheet whenever you update your backup. If you die, you revert to those statistics, losing any traits or character points acquired since then. Note that a copy exists before you die. You must tell the GM where you store it. You will return to life at that location . . . and if your enemies discover where you store your copy, they may tamper with it! -20%.

{{Indent}}Requires Body: You come back in disembodied state - for instance, as a spirit or a digital copy on a computer. All your experiences and abilities are intact (unless you took Copy), but you cannot interact with the physical world at all until you acquire a new body. This might be a clone, an undead corpse, or even a robot &quot;shell.&quot; -20%, or -40% if the required body is illegal, rare, or expensive (GM's decision).
