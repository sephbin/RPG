Sirquine Plains
The Sirquine Plains, bordering the Kavenderblight Wasteland, shares a similar curse to the duster Kavender Oblivion. Although the earth contains moisture and vitamins, the plant life of the plains grow colourless. The plains are home to roving wild horses and predators built to survive in a colourless environment.
The beautiful Toko Kestrel grows amazing feathers, silvery blue across the belly and the underside of the wings, and a mottled grey on its back. This stealth tactic keeps it invisible to potential prey and predators.
