|{{Indent}}A Secret Identity is a special kind of Secret (above): it is another persona that you use for deeds that you don't want connected with your &quot;public&quot; self. Only your closest family and friends know, and you are willing to go to great lengths to keep your privacy. This is a disadvantage because it limits your behavior. It is difficult (and often illegal) to maintain a Secret Identity.

{{Indent}}The GM will roll to see whether your Secret Identity factors into a game session, just as for any Secret. If it does, this usually takes the form of someone who threatens to expose your real identity. Anyone with Status 3 or higher gets an extra -10 points for a Secret Identity, because of the attention the media and public pay to his every move, but the GM will introduce a challenge to his identity on a roll of 7 or less instead of the usual 6 or less.

{{Indent}}A Secret Identity otherwise works just like any other Secret, its point value depending on the severity of the consequences should it be exposed.
