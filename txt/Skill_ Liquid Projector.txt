|{{Indent}}This is the ability to use a weapon that projects a stream of liquid or gas. Roll against Liquid Projector skill to hit your target

{{Indent}}Make an IQ-based Liquid Projector roll to take immediate action (e.g., patch a leak), should your weapon fail

{{Indent}}You must specialize by weapon type:

{{Indent}}&lt;i&gt;Flamethrower:&lt;/i&gt; Any weapon that projects burning liquid or gas. (This does not include plasma weapons, which are often called &quot;flamers&quot;; use Beam Weapons skill for those.)

{{Indent}}&lt;i&gt;Sprayer:&lt;/i&gt; Any weapon that emits a gas or atomized liquid (nerve gas, sleeping gas, etc.), including an ordinary spray can used as an improvised weapon

{{Indent}}&lt;i&gt;Squirt Gun:&lt;/i&gt; Any weapon that fires a low-pressure stream of liquid at the rate of one squirt per pull of the trigger

{{Indent}}&lt;i&gt;Water Cannon:&lt;/i&gt; Any weapon that fires a continuous jet of high-pressure liquid, usually but not always water, with the intent of causing knockback

{{Indent}}These specialties default to one another at -4. The weapons covered by each specialty vary by TL; e.g., Liquid Projector (Flamethrower) covers firesiphons loaded with Greek fire at TL4, while at TL6, it covers backpack tanks that project thickened fuel

{{Indent}}&lt;font color=&quot;#006AFF&quot; size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Modifiers: All applicable ranged combat modifiers; -2 for heavy weapons when you are used to portable weapons (e.g., a flamethrower mounted on a tank when you are used to a backpack model), or for an unfamiliar weapon of a known type; -4 or more for a weapon in bad repair.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;
