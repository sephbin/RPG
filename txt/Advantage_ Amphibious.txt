|{{Indent}}You are well-adapted to movement in the water. You do not suffer skill penalties for working underwater, and you can swim at your full Basic Move. You still require air (but see Doesn't Breathe, p. 49). Typical features include smooth, seal-like skin and webbed fingers and toes.

{{Indent}}If you can move only in the water, take the Aquatic disadvantage (p. 145) instead.
