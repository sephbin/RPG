|{{Indent}}You may only apply this limitation to a disadvantage. A particular item or substance - the mitigator - temporarily negates your disadvantage. The more effective the mitigator, the fewer points you get for the disadvantage. Use the following guidelines:

{{Indent}}Mitigator is vulnerable, and easily stolen, broken, or misplaced (e.g., a pair of glasses). -60%.

{{Indent}}Mitigator is a drug or other treatment that you must take daily. -60%.

{{Indent}}Mitigator is a weekly treatment. -65%.

{{Indent}}Mitigator is a monthly treatment. -70%.

{{Indent}}This assumes your treatments are available at pharmacies. If you require a special (and possibly expensive) prescription, add +5% to the values above; e.g., -70% becomes -65%. If you can only get your treatments from one specific source, such as an experimental drug program, add +10%; e.g., -70% becomes -60%.

{{Indent}}Example 1: Bad Sight is worth -25 points. Glasses cure Bad Sight while worn, but are breakable, for a -60% Mitigator limitation. This reduces Bad Sight to -10 points.

{{Indent}}Example 2: Jan has AIDS, and would die in a month without treatment. This level of Terminally Ill is normally worth -100 points. Fortunately, Jan is on an experimental drug plan that is holding him in remission. The treatments are weekly (-65%) but impossible to find outside his program (+10%), for a -55% Mitigator limitation. This reduces Terminally Ill to -45 points. As long as Jan stays with the program, his countdown to death is halted.
