|{{Indent}}You are impossible to influence through ordinary words or actions. Those who wish to use Influence skills on you (see Influence Rolls, p. 359) must possess a suitable advantage:

{{Indent}}Empathy (p. 51) if you are a human or similar being, Animal Empathy (p. 40) if you're a beast, Plant Empathy (p. 75) if you're a plant, or Spirit Empathy (p. 88) if you're a demon, ghost, etc. Everyone else - however convincing - fails automatically. This trait often accompanies Unfazeable (p. 95).
