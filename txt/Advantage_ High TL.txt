|{{Indent}}Your personal TL is above that of the campaign world. You may enter play with skills relating to equipment up to your personal TL. This is most useful if you also have access to highTL equipment (see Tech Level and Equipment,p.27), but the knowledge of a high-tech doctor or scientist can be very useful in a low-tech setting, even without specialized equipment!
