|{{Indent}}Prerequisites: Possession and either Ally or Dependent.

{{Indent}}A Puppet is an Ally (p. 36) or Dependent (p. 131) who cannot resist your Possession advantage (p. 75). When you use Possession on him, you succeed automatically! This may be due to his nature or some special knowledge you have: a curse, his true name, the key to his mind, etc.

{{Indent}}A Puppet will always have IQ 0, or owe you a Duty (p. 133), or be Reprogrammable (p. 150). If he has a Duty, it must be Involuntary, and its frequency must be identical to the Puppet's own frequency of appearance as an Ally or Dependent.

{{Indent}}Each Puppet costs 5 points. You can buy an entire group of related Allies as Puppets for 10 points. These costs are for the Puppet advantage only; you must pay for your Ally or Dependent separately. It is common but not mandatory for such Allies to have the Minion enhancement or the Unwilling limitation.
