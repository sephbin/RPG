{{Indent}}This is the ability to do library and file research. Roll against skill to find a useful piece of data in an appropriate place of research . . . if the information is there to be found

{{Indent}}At the GM's option, when researching material connected with a &quot;booklearned&quot; skill such as Forensics, Literature, or Physics, you may roll against that skill at -2 instead, if that would be better than your Research skill or default (but this is not a general default level)
