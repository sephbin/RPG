|{{Indent}}Your body temperature fluctuates with the temperature of the environment. You are less susceptible to damage from high or low body temperature (+2 HT to resist the effects of temperature), and require only 1/3 the food needed by a warm-blooded being of equal mass, but you tend to &quot;stiffen up&quot; in cold weather.

{{Indent}}After 30 minutes in cold conditions (or one hour if you have any level of Temperature Tolerance), you get -1 to Basic Speed and DX per 10째 below your &quot;threshold temperature&quot; (see below). At temperatures below 32째, you must roll vs. HT or take 1 HP of damage. Warm clothing gives +2 to this roll.

{{Indent}}You regain lost Basic Speed and DX at the rate of one point of each per hour once you return to a warm climate. Double this rate in an exceptionally warm environment.

{{Indent}}Point value depends on your &quot;threshold temperature&quot;:

{{Indent}}You &quot;stiffen up&quot; below 50째: -5 points.

{{Indent}}You &quot;stiffen up&quot; below 65째: -10 points.
