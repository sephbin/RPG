|{{Indent}}You can physically change into one or more forms different from your native form. To shift between forms, you must concentrate for 10 seconds. To speed this up, add Reduced Time (p. 108).

{{Indent}}Fatigue, injury, crippling, and afflictions carry over between forms - although HP and FP losses scale in proportion to the HP and FP of the form. For instance, if you suffer 10 HP of damage and a broken leg in a form that has 20 HP, you will have 5 HP of damage and a broken leg when you switch to a form that has only 10 HP.

{{Indent}}If you are knocked out or killed, you immediately revert to your native form (which will also be unconscious or dead). In addition, you must specify a single, reasonably common external influence that can force you to return to your native form against your will. This should suit the advantage's origin: a Dispel Magic spell if your ability is magical, exorcism if a spirit power, strong magnetic fields if technological, etc.

{{Indent}}Shapeshifting comprises two different traits: Alternate Form and Morph.


----

{{Indent}}&lt;font size=&quot;3&quot;&gt;'''Morph'''&lt;/font&gt;

{{Indent}}Variable

{{Indent}}This ability is similar to Alternate Form, but not limited to specific racial templates. You can assume any racial template, within certain limits.

{{Indent}}First, the racial template must already exist in your game world. The GM might design the template himself or take one from a GURPS worldbook, but you cannot design totally new templates for the purpose of Morph (you can adjust existing ones, though; see below).

{{Indent}}Second, you can only turn into a living being, or a formerly living being such as a vampire. To change into a machine requires a special enhancement.

{{Indent}}Finally, the template's point value must be within a limit determined by the number of points you have in Morph.

{{Indent}}If you can assume any racial template worth no more than your native one, Morph costs 100 points. This makes many forms available - anything no more powerful than your native form. For a human, this includes cats, insects, owls, and wolves. If you can assume more powerful forms, add the difference between the maximum racial template cost and the cost of your native template to the base 100 points. For instance, a human who can take on any racial template worth up to 75 points would pay 175 points for Morph. You may improve this limit with earned character points.

{{Indent}}You can always take on the form of a being you can see or touch, provided its racial template cost does not exceed your maximum. Once you have assumed a form, you can opt to memorize it by concentrating for one minute. This allows you to shapeshift into that form at any time. You can memorize a number of forms equal to your IQ. If all your &quot;slots&quot; are full, you must overwrite a previously memorized form (your choice) to add the new form.

{{Indent}}As with Alternate Form, the racial template of whatever you turn into replaces your native racial template. You may not add traits to templates, but you may freely omit racial mental disadvantages (e.g., Bestial), and you may always choose to drop the racial IQ modifier from a template and use your own IQ. Such changes raise the cost of animal templates, which are cheap due to limited mental capabilities. If you intend to do this, you should spend more than the minimum 100 points on Morph.

{{Indent}}Morph includes the ability to make cosmetic changes. This lets you impersonate a specific member of any race you can turn into. You can always impersonate someone who is present - but to assume his form later on, you must commit a memory &quot;slot&quot; to that form. With enough points in Morph, you can use this function to improve appearance. For instance, 115 points in Morph would let you give yourself any appearance from Horrific to Handsome. Cosmetic changes still take the usual 10 seconds.

{{Indent}}Shapeshifting Races: Members of a race with the Morph ability must subtract the point cost of Morph from racial cost when determining what forms they can assume.

{{Indent}}Example: Blue Blobs have a racial Morph ability worth 125 points - the basic ability, plus 25 points of extra capacity. This lets them assume forms worth 25 points more than their native one. With their other traits, their total racial cost is 175 points. However, for the purpose of Morph, they are considered to have a racial cost of 175 - 125 = 50 points. With their 25 points of additional capacity, Blue Blobs can turn into creatures worth up to 75 points.

{{Indent}}Doppelgangers: Alien blobs, liquidmetal robots, and horrific monsters that &quot;replace&quot; their prey can assume the form of almost any living being they sample, within the limits of their mass. This is Morph with Mass Conservation (-20%) and Needs Sample (from -5% for a robot that needs a single cell to -50% for a monster that devours its victims) - often with many points of extra capacity. Some robots and aliens can shift into unliving forms. A robot restricted to unliving forms is about as limited as a living being that can only take living forms; there's no extra cost. To assume living and unliving forms, add Unlimited (+50%).

{{Indent}}Mythic Morphs: Gods and wizards in many tales can instantly take the form of any earthly creature. This powerful capability is Morph, with a lot of extra capacity to cover strong, capable forms - like tigers and sharks - while retaining IQ. No Memorization Required (+50%) and Reduced Time 4 (+80%) agree with most tales. The Unlimited enhancement (+50%) is common but not universal.

&lt;font size=&quot;3&quot;&gt;'''Special Enhancements'''&lt;/font&gt;

{{Indent}}Unlimited: You can become anything the GM has defined with a racial template. This lets you turn into robots, vehicles, etc. as well as living beings. Most ordinary inanimate objects - such as bricks and toasters - are worth 0 points or less. With the GM's permission, you can become a typical example of an object like this without the need for a specific racial template. +50%.

{{Indent}}Active Change: Your transformation takes the usual amount of time, but you needn't concentrate during this time - you can move and act. You have the abilities of the form you're changing from until the transition is complete. (GMs who enjoy extra detail can average the forms' statistics, or even use a weighted average to reflect how far along the change has come.) +20%.

{{Indent}}Improvised Forms: Only for Morph. You can improvise new racial templates as you change, mixing and matching the natural physical traits you desire. Possibilities range from modifying your native form with a useful body part to creating a completely new template. Improvised templates can't cost more than what you can afford with your Morph ability, but can include physical disadvantages to reduce costs. All traits added must exist in your game world, unless you also have Cosmic (+50%). You can't change your composition (e.g., add elemental meta-traits or Insubstantiality) without Unlimited (+50%). +100%.

{{Indent}}No Memorization Required: Only for Morph. Any shape you take instantly becomes part of your repertoire, unless you don't want to memorize it for some reason. +50%.

{{Indent}}
----

&lt;font size=&quot;3&quot;&gt;'''Special Limitations'''&lt;/font&gt;

{{Indent}}Cosmetic: You can only change your outward appearance. Your abilities and racial template are unaffected. -50%. This limitation includes Mass Conservation, but not Retains Shape.

{{Indent}}Mass Conservation: All your forms have the same weight. If the weight of your native form falls outside the normal racial weight range for a race, you simply cannot become a member of that race. The GM should be merciless when enforcing this limitation - no 150-lb. mice or elephants! -20%.

{{Indent}}Retains Shape: You can only assume forms with the same number of limbs, body layout, posture, etc. as your native form. This would limit a human Morph to humanoids (e.g., elves and giants), a wolf Morph to horizontal quadrupeds, and a bird Morph to other birds. -20%.

{{Indent}}Cannot Memorize Forms: Only for Morph. You can't memorize the forms you copy. To assume a form, you must always be able to see or touch the original. -50%.

{{Indent}}Flawed: Only for Morph. Every form you take is cosmetically imperfect in some way, which completely precludes impersonation. You still gain the abilities of your new form. Flawed is mutually incompatible with Cosmetic. -10%.

{{Indent}}Needs Sample: Only for Morph. You must physically sample anything you wish to take the form of. If your target is living, this sample must be fresh - you can't sample a rotting corpse. -5% if you need only touch the target; -15% if you require a drop of blood, strand of hair, etc.; -50% if you must eat the whole target.

{{Indent}}Unliving Forms Only: Only for Morph. You can turn into objects but not creatures. You enjoy most of the capabilities of the Unlimited enhancement, but you can't assume the template of anything alive. -0%.
