|{{Indent}}Air, smoke, and other gases are like solid ground beneath your feet, allowing you to walk up and down &quot;invisible stairs&quot; at your ground Move. This won't work in a vacuum - there has to be some kind of air present. If you get knocked down or slip, you fall! You may attempt one DX roll per second of falling. If you succeed, you stop in thin air, unharmed. Otherwise, you hit the ground for normal falling damage (see Falling, p. 431).

{{Indent}}Lighter Than Air: Your ability works by making you lighter than air or gaseous. Wind moves you a yard per second in the direction it's blowing per 5 mph of wind speed. -10%.

{{Indent}}Maximum Height: You can't walk very high off the ground. A 30-foot limit is -10%; a 10-foot limit is -20%; and a 5-foot limit is -25%.

{{Indent}}Planetary: You push off against a planet's gravity field or walk along its magnetic field lines. Your ability is useless in the absence of a planet. -5%.

{{Indent}}Vertical Only: You can only climb straight up, as if using a ladder made of air. You can't move laterally at all. -25%.
