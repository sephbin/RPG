|{{Indent}}You are unusually talented at reading the motivations of animals. When you meet an animal, the GM rolls against your IQ and tells you what you &quot;feel.&quot; This reveals the beast's emotional state - friendly, frightened, hostile, hungry, etc. - and whether it is under supernatural control. You may also use your Influence skills (see p. 359) on animals just as you would on sapient beings, which usually ensures a positive reaction.

{{Indent}}This ability frequently accompanies some level of Animal Friend (see Talent, p. 89), and often Sense of Duty (Animals) or Vow (Vegetarianism).
