|{{Indent}}You have an attack that causes a baneful, nondamaging effect: blindness, paralysis, weakness, etc. This might be an ultra-tech beam weapon, a chemical spray, a supernatural gaze attack, or almost anything else. Specify the details when you buy the advantage.

{{Indent}}By default, Affliction is a ranged attack with 1/2D 10, Max 100, Acc 3, RoF 1, Shots N/A, and Recoil 1, although you can apply modifiers to change these statistics (see pp. 101- 116).

{{Indent}}If you hit, your victim gets a HT+1 roll to resist. Apply a penalty equal to the level of the Affliction (so Affliction 1 gives an unmodified HT roll). The victim gets a bonus equal to his DR unless the Affliction has one of the following modifiers: Blood Agent, Contact Agent, Cosmic, Follow-Up, Malediction, Respiratory Agent or Sense-Based. To reduce the effects of DR, add the Armor Divisor enhancement. The victim gets a further +3 if he is beyond 1/2D range.

{{Indent}}If the victim makes his HT roll, he is unaffected. If he fails, he suffers the effects of the Affliction. By default, he is stunned (see p. 420). He may roll vs. HT+1 once per second to recover, but once again at a penalty equal to the level of the Affliction (DR has no effect on this roll).

{{Indent}}If your Affliction causes an effect other than stunning, this is a special enhancement (see below). You can inflict more than one effect by giving your Affliction multiple special enhancements. These effects occur simultaneously, except where noted.

{{Indent}}Successive Afflictions that produce the same effects are not normally cumulative. Use the single worst effect.

{{Indent}}Use the Special Enhancements below to create specific Afflictions. Many Attack Enhancements and Limitations (p. 102) are also logical. For instance, a blinding flash is Sense- Based (p. 109); most drugs have Follow-Up (p. 105), Blood Agent (p. 102), or Contact Agent (p. 103); supernatural attacks like the &quot;evil eye&quot; use Malediction (p. 106); and touch attacks call for Melee Attack (p. 112).

{{Indent}}If an Affliction produces two or more effects due to the special enhancements below, some of these effects may be secondary. Secondary effects occur only if the victim fails his HT roll by 5 or more or rolls a critical failure. A secondary effect is worth 1/5 as much; e.g., Secondary Heart Attack is +60% rather than +300%.

{{Indent}}Once you have chosen all the modifiers on your Affliction, describe the nature of the attack as detailed for Innate Attack (p. 61).

&lt;font size=&quot;3&quot;&gt;'''Special Enhancements'''&lt;/font&gt;

{{Indent}}Advantage: The victim immediately experiences the effects of a specific physical or mental advantage. Advantages with instantaneous effects affect the target once, as soon as he is hit, if he fails his HT roll; e.g., Warp immediately teleports the subject. Advantages that can be switched on and off (such as Insubstantiality) are automatically &quot;on&quot; for one minute per point by which the victim fails his HT roll, and are not under the subject's control. This is worth +10% per point the advantage is worth; e.g., Insubstantiality would be +800%! If the advantage comes in levels, specify the level.

{{Indent}}Attribute Penalty: The victim suffers temporary attribute loss. This is +5% per -1 to ST or HT, or +10% per -1 to DX or IQ. For instance, an attack that caused DX-3 and IQ-2 would be +50%. Lower all skills based on reduced attributes by a like amount. ST penalties also reduce BL and damage, while IQ reductions also apply to Will and Perception. Secondary characteristics are not otherwise affected; for instance, HT reduction does not affect Basic Speed or FP. Penalties last for one minute per point by which the victim fails his HT roll.

{{Indent}}Coma: The victim collapses, profoundly unconscious, and will likely die in days unless treated; see Mortal Conditions (p. 429). +250%.

{{Indent}}Cumulative: Repeated attacks are cumulative! You must take this in conjunction with Attribute Penalty, or with an Advantage, Disadvantage, or Negated Advantage Enhancement that inflicts a &quot;leveled&quot; trait. +400%.

{{Indent}}Disadvantage: The victim temporarily gains one or more specific physical or mental disadvantages (but not self-imposed mental disadvantages - see p. 121). This is worth +1% per point the temporary disadvantages are worth; e.g., Paranoia [-10] is worth +10%. If a disadvantage comes in levels, specify the level. The disadvantages last for one minute per point by which the victim fails his HT roll.

{{Indent}}Heart Attack: The victim suffers an incapacitating heart attack, and will die in minutes unless treated; see Mortal Conditions (p. 429). +300%.

{{Indent}}Incapacitation: The victim is incapacitated for a number of minutes equal to the margin of failure on his HT roll. After that, he is stunned until he can make a HT roll (roll once per second). If you combine Incapacitation with other effects (such as Irritant), those effects occur after the Incapacitation wears off; they replace the stunning and last for the same length of time the Incapacitation did. Incapacitation can take the form of any of the following: Daze, +50%; Hallucinating, +50%; Retching, +50%; Agony, +100%; Choking, +100%; Ecstasy, +100%; Seizure, +100%; Paralysis, +150%; Sleep, +150%; or Unconsciousness, +200%. See Incapacitating Conditions (p. 428) for the game effects.

{{Indent}}Irritant: The victim suffers an impairing but non-incapacitating condition instead of being stunned. It lasts for a number of minutes equal to the margin of failure on his HT roll. The possibilities are Tipsy +10%; Coughing, +20%; Drunk, +20%; Moderate Pain, +20%; Euphoria, &quot;+30%; Nauseated, +30%; Severe Pain, &quot;+40%; or Terrible Pain, +60%. For definitions, see Irritating Conditions (p. 428).

{{Indent}}Negated Advantage: The victim loses a specific advantage for one minute per point by which he failed his HT roll. There is no effect if the victim lacks that advantage! This enhancement is worth +1% per point the advantage is worth. If the advantage comes in levels, you must specify the level negated.

{{Indent}}Stunning: May only accompany Advantage, Attribute Penalty, Disadvantage, or Negated Advantage. If the victim fails to resist, he is stunned (per an unmodified Affliction) in addition to the effects of the other enhancement(s). +10%.

{{Indent}}Beam: A ranged attack that affects one target; e.g., a paralysis beam or a shrinking ray. This is the most basic form of Affliction. It's especially suitable for supers, gods, and ultra-tech beam weapons. Roll against Innate Attack (Beam) to hit.

{{Indent}}Curse: Fantasy and horror Afflictions are more often &quot;spells&quot; than &quot;bolts of power,&quot; with the attacker calling upon supernatural forces to weaken or incapacitate his foe. The only requirement is Malediction 1 (+100%). To simulate the spells on pp. B242-253, add suitable levels of Costs Fatigue (-5%/level) and Takes Extra Time (-10%/level). Most mental effects are Based on Will (+20%). There's never any roll to hit; Maledictions use a Will roll instead.

{{Indent}}Field: The user constantly emits a baneful effect; e.g., a demon might cause those who approach too closely to suffer Agony (+100%). If he affects everyone around him once, when they first come within range, take Area Effect (+50%/level) and Emanation (-20%). If he automatically attacks anyone he touches or who touches him each time he makes contact, use Aura (+80%) and Melee Attack (-30%) instead. In either case, add Always On. This is a -10% limitation, as Afflictions are socially inconvenient but not physically troublesome for the user. No roll to hit is required, but those with Aura can actively try to affect a victim by making a melee attack.

{{Indent}}Gas: Sleeping gas, paralysis gas, and the like. Such Afflictions have Area Effect (+50%/level) and one of Respiratory Agent (+50%), Blood Agent (+100%), or Contact Agent (+150%). For a mobile gas cloud, add Drifting (+20%) and Persistent (+40%). A gas that surrounds the attacker has Emanation (-20%) instead. Insidious gases have No Signature (+20%) and possibly Onset (variable). There's no roll to hit; gas has a chance of affecting everyone exposed to it.

{{Indent}}Gaze: A gaze is a common vehicle for supernatural Afflictions. For instance, a hypnotic gaze might cause the target to sleep. If the gaze works on any target the attacker can see, it has the Vision-Based enhancement (+150%). Roll against Innate Attack (Gaze) to hit. Gaze attacks by fantasy monsters tend to be short-ranged and curse-like; apply Malediction 1 (+100%) and the Vision-Based limitation (-20%) instead. To affect the target, make the usual Will roll for Malediction.

{{Indent}}Mental Blast: Direct mind-to-mind attacks that stun or daze are common psi abilities. Such Afflictions have Malediction 2 (+150%) and Based on Will (+20%). If the attack is totally undetectable, add No Signature (+20%). As with all Maledictions, the only roll required is a Will roll.

{{Indent}}Sensory Attack: Some Afflictions affect everyone nearby though their senses. Such attacks have Area Effect (+50%/level) and Emanation (-20%). Bright flashes are Vision-Based (+150%), with a Disadvantage enhancement that inflicts Blindness (+50%); howls, thunderclaps, etc., are Hearing-Based (+150%), and cause Deafness (+20%). As with gas, no roll to hit is necessary - everyone in the area is exposed.

{{Indent}}Touch: Monsters, wizards, and supers often have to touch those they wish to afflict. The simplest form of this is Melee Attack (-30%). Attacks that must touch bare skin or an open wound have Contact Agent (-30%) or Blood Agent (-40%), respectively, while supernatural attacks that bypass DR get Malediction 1 (+100%). Make an unarmed melee attack to hit. For Malediction, roll the Quick Contest to see if the Affliction works only after scoring a hit.

{{Indent}}Venom: Toxins often cause weakness, paralysis, unconsciousness, coma, or heart attack. Those borne on fangs, claws, etc. have Follow-Up (+0%), while poisonous spray or spit has Contact Agent (-30%) or Blood Agent (-40%). Many poisons take time to work; if so, add Onset (variable). Make a melee attack to hit with a natural weapon. Roll against Innate Attack (Breath) to hit with spray or spit.

{{Indent}}Negated Disadvantage: The victim loses a specific disadvantage for one minute per point by which he fails his HT roll. If he lacks that disadvantage, there's no effect. This is worth +10% per point the disadvantage is worth. If the disadvantage comes in levels, specify the level negated.
