Moody Island
This tropical island seems peaceful at first glances, but only after several exploration expeditions, not all of its sinister secrets have been revealed.
What current civilisation knows is that it was once inhabited by element worshipping humans., the insect life of the island is unnaturally large (similar to other parts of Eorith), and various insects &amp; arachnids have organic crystalline structures, incredibly beautiful life forms. Only one crystalline spider has been documented: the Van de Viir Spider, feeds off natural forming crystals such as quartz or amethyst. The small spiders also poison typical insects with an unusual venom that solidifies their flesh, turning them to semi-precious stone. The crystallised corpses are unstable and crumble to dust, but once solidified, the spiders feed upon the processed food.
Another fascinating insect living on the island is the Mustard Ant, given the name purely for its aromatic and flavoursome similarities with mustard.
