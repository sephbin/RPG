Many fictional heroes have partners
– loyal comrades, faithful sidekicks,
trusted retainers, or lifelong
friends – who accompany them on
adventures. These partners are
“Allies.”

The other PCs in your adventuring
party are, in a sense, “allies.” But
they can be unreliable allies indeed.
Often they are chance acquaintances,
first encountered at a roadside
tavern only hours ago. They have
their own hidden goals, ethics, and
motives, which might not coincide
with your own.

An NPC Ally, on the other hand, is
wholly reliable. Perhaps you fought
side by side in a long war, trained
under the same master, or grew up in
the same village. The two of you trust
each other implicitly. You travel
together, fight back-to-back, share
rations in hard times, and trade
watches through the night.

Your Ally is usually agreeable to
your suggestions, but he is not your
puppet. He will disagree with you
from time to time. An Ally may try to
dissuade you from a plan that seems
foolish to him – and if he can’t talk you
out of the plan, he may refuse to cooperate.
An Ally may even cause problems
for you: picking fights, landing in
jail, insulting a high noble . . . Of
course, the Ally will also try to bail you
out when you make mistakes.

The GM will not award you bonus
character points for any play session
in which you betray, attack, or unnecessarily
endanger your Ally. Blatant,
prolonged, or severe betrayal will
break the trust between you and your
Ally, and he will leave you permanently.
If you drive your Ally off in this way,
the points you spent on him are gone,
reducing your point value. Leading
your Ally into danger is all right, as
long as you face the same danger and
are a responsible leader.

The point cost for an Ally depends
on his power and frequency of appearance.
Only PCs who take NPCs as
Allies pay points for the privilege. Two
PCs can be mutual “allies” for free, as
can two NPCs – and NPCs never pay
points for PCs as Allies. An Ally is
specifically a skilled NPC associate for
one PC.

----

'''Ally’s Power'''

Consult the following table to
determine how many points you must
spend on your Ally. “Point Total” is the
Ally’s point total expressed as a percentage
of the PC’s starting points;
“Cost” is the cost of the Ally. If the
Ally’s point total falls between two
percentages, use the higher.

{|
| '''Point Total'''
| '''Cost'''
|-
| 25%
| 1 Point
|-
| 50%
| 2 Points
|-
| 75%
| 3 Poins
|-
| 100%
| 5 Points
|-
| 150%
| 10 Points
|}

Allies built on more than 150% of
the PC’s starting points are not allowed;
treat such NPCs as Patrons (see p. 72).
Exception: The progression above
extends indefinitely for nonsentient (IQ
0) Allies; each +50% of the PC’s starting
points costs a further +5 points.

Allies built on no more than 100%
of the PC’s starting points may also be
Dependents (see p. 131). Add the cost
of Ally and Dependent together, and
treat the combination as a single
trait: an advantage if the total point
cost is positive, a disadvantage if it is
negative.

----

'''Ally Groups'''

You may purchase as many Allies
as you can afford. Each Ally is normally
a separate advantage, but you
can treat a group of related Allies as a
single trait to save space on your character
sheet. For a group of individuals
– with their own unique abilities and
character sheets – add the costs of the
individual Allies to find the cost of the
group, adjust the total cost for frequency
of appearance, and then apply
any special modifiers.

For a group of more than five identical
and interchangeable allies that
share a single character sheet – for
instance, an army of low-grade thugs
or a swarm of robot drones – find the
point cost to have one member of the
group as an Ally, and then multiply
that cost as follows to find the cost of
the group:

{|
|Size of Group
|Multiplier
|-
|6-10
|x6
|-
|11-20
|x8
|-
|21-50
|x10
|-
|51-100
|x12
|}
Add x6 to the multiplier per tenfold
increase in number (e.g., 100,000
Allies would be x30). The GM may
require an Unusual Background
(p. 96) if you wish to have hordes of Allies, or even prohibit groups larger
than a certain size – although he
might permit an army or other large
group as a Patron. Frequency of
appearance multipliers and special
modifiers (if any) apply to the final
cost of the entire group.

----

'''Frequency of Appearance'''

Choose a frequency of appearance
(see p. 36). If your Ally appears at the
start of an adventure, he accompanies
you for the duration of that adventure.

Whether you pay points for a useful relationship with an NPC or collect
points for a troublesome one, it is unlikely that the NPC will be a constant
presence. Each friend or foe has a frequency of appearance, and will
figure into a given adventure only if the GM rolls less than or equal to that
number on 3d at the start of the adventure. How the NPC interacts with
you if the roll succeeds depends on the nature of the relationship.

Frequency of appearance multiplies the point cost for an Associated
NPC (see p. 31) after determining power level and group size (as applicable),
but before you apply any special modifiers:

:Constantly (no roll required): x4. The NPC is always present. This level is reserved for NPCs – usually Allies – that are implanted, worn like clothing, or supernaturally attached.

:Almost all the time (roll of 15 or less): x3.

:Quite often (roll of 12 or less): x2.

:Fairly often (roll of 9 or less): x1.

:Quite rarely (roll of 6 or less): x1/2 (round up).

----

'''Allies in Play'''

As with Dependents (p. 131), the
GM will adjust your Ally’s abilities in
order to keep his point total a fixed
percentage of your own as you earn
points. This will keep his value as an
advantage constant. The GM decides
how the Ally evolves, although he
might ask you for your input.

If your Ally dies through no fault of
yours, the GM will not penalize you.
You may put the points spent on the
deceased Ally toward a new Ally. The
new relationship should normally
develop gradually, but the GM might
allow an NPC to become an Ally on
the spot if you have done something
that would win him over (e.g., saving
his life). This is especially appropriate
in cultures where debts of honor are
taken seriously!

There is no penalty for amicably
parting ways with your Ally. You may
use the points spent on him to buy a
new Ally met during play. At the GM’s
discretion, you may trade in any
remaining points for money (see
p. 26), reflecting parting gifts.

----

'''Familiars'''

Wizards, telepaths, and so on are
often supernaturally linked to special
Allies known as familiars. These are
usually animals or spirits.

Work out a familiar’s basic abilities
with the GM, starting with the racial
template of an ordinary creature of its
kind. If its racial IQ is 5 or less, raise it
to at least 6. Consider buying off
Cannot Speak, if applicable. Most
familiars have supernatural advantages:
Extra Lives for a cat (it has nine
lives, after all!), Mindlink and Telesend
for a familiar that can transmit its
thoughts, etc.

Once you have determined the
familiar’s abilities, work out its point
total and its base value as an Ally.
Select frequency of appearance as
usual. This may be how often your
familiar is available (on a failed
appearance roll, it is sleeping, reporting
to a demon lord, etc.) or how often
its powers work (on a failure, it is no
more capable than an ordinary member
of its species, and cannot use or
grant special powers) – your choice.

This kind of Ally usually has one or
more special modifiers. Minion,
Summonable, and Sympathy are common.
Unwilling is typical of demonic
or otherwise evil familiars. Take
Special Abilities only if your familiar
grants you powers; e.g., extra Fatigue
Points with which to fuel spells or
exotic or supernatural advantages that
emulate the familiar’s own abilities
(such as Flight, for a bird). You have
no access to these abilities on a failed
appearance roll; if your familiar is
stunned, unconscious, or dead; or in
areas where your special link does not
function (GM’s decision). Buy these
abilities with a -40% Accessibility
limitation: “Granted by familiar.”

----

You can apply the following
enhancements and limitations after
calculating group cost (if applicable)
and multiplying for frequency of
appearance:

'''Special Enhancements'''

''Minion:'' Your Ally continues to
serve you regardless of how well you
treat him. This might be due to programming,
fear, awe, or lack of selfawareness.
Examples include robots,
zombies, and magical slaves. You are
free of the usual obligation to treat
your Ally well. Mistreatment might
result in an inconvenient breakdown
(mental or physical), but the Ally will
not leave. See Puppet (p. 78) for additional
options. ''+0%'' if the Minion has
IQ 0 or Slave Mentality (p. 154), as the
benefits of total loyalty are offset by
the need for close supervision; ''+50%''
otherwise.
''Special Abilities:'' Your Ally wields
power out of proportion to his point
value. Perhaps he has extensive political
clout or access to equipment from
a TL higher than your own; perhaps
he grants you exotic powers. Don’t
apply this enhancement simply
because your Ally has exotic abilities.
If his powers are very uncommon, you
will already be paying extra: your Ally
requires an Unusual Background,
which raises his point total and his
value as an Ally. ''+50%.''
''Summonable:'' You conjure your
Ally instead of rolling to see whether
he appears at the start of an adventure.
To do so, take a Concentrate
maneuver and roll against frequency
of appearance. On a success, your Ally
appears nearby. On a failure, you cannot
attempt to summon him again for
one full day. Dismissing your Ally is a
free action, but you may only dismiss
him if he is physically present. ''+100%.''

'''Special Limitations'''

''Sympathy:'' If you are stunned,
knocked out, mind-controlled, etc.,
your Ally is similarly affected. The
reverse is also true, so you should take
special care of your Ally! ''-25%'' if the
death of one party reduces the other to
0 HP; -50% if the death of one party
automatically kills the other. If your
wounds affect your Ally, but your Ally’s
wounds don’t affect you, reduce these
values to ''-5%'' and ''-10%.''

''Unwilling:'' You have obtained your
Ally through coercion (e.g., blackmail
or magical binding). You do not have
to treat him as well as you would a
normal Ally. However, he hates you
and is likely to act accordingly, reducing
his overall reliability level. If you
endanger such an Ally or order him to
do something unpleasant, he may
rebel (GM’s option) if the consequences
of doing so would be less
severe than those of doing your bidding.
An Ally who rebels is gone, along
with the points you spent on him.
''-50%.''
