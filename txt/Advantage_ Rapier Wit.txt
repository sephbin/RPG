|{{Indent}}You can use witty repartee to stun your foes in combat. This does not require a combat maneuver - talking is a free action (p. 363). Roll a Quick Contest of Public Speaking skill vs. your opponent's Will.

{{Indent}}Modifiers: -2 if your target has the Clueless or No Sense of Humor disadvantage; any modifier the GM assigns based on your description of the verbal attack; -1 per opponent beyond the first to affect a group (and you must know something the entire group has in common; e.g., they're all flunkies of the same household or members of the same military unit). Opponents with the Unfazeable advantage (p. 95) are immune to Rapier Wit.

{{Indent}}If you win, your opponent is mentally stunned (see p. 420). A critical success causes one HP of physical damage as well - your victim injures himself accidentally (drops something on his foot, chokes on his own tongue, etc.). If you lose, there is no effect. On a critical failure, you enrage your opponent, possibly triggering such disadvantages as Berserk and Bloodlust!

{{Indent}}This advantage is usually only appropriate in a silly campaign!

{{Indent}}Words of Power: You faze opponents with the supernatural might inherent in your words or voice. Perhaps you know magic words from the dawn of creation - or speak with the voice of the gods! Language is no barrier, and you can affect those who have the Unfazeable advantage. To use your ability, roll a Quick Contest of Will with your opponent, ignoring modifiers for Clueless and No Sense of Humor. Standard penalties apply if trying to affect a group. +100%.
