|{{Indent}}This is the ability to calm the emotions, control the mind, and relax the body. To use this skill, you must concentrate for (20 - skill) seconds, minimum one second, and then roll vs. skill. On a success, you enter a trancelike state, which you can maintain for hours

{{Indent}}A meditative trance is required for certain rituals and is a common preparation for prayer. In addition, the GM may permit you to meditate on a particular moral dilemma. On a successful Meditation roll, the GM will &quot;enlighten&quot; you, providing a hint as to which course of action &quot;feels&quot; right
