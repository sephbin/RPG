|{{Indent}}This is the skill of using a typewriter. Typing speed is skill x 3 words per minute (wpm) on a manual, skill x 5 wpm on an electric typewriter or computer keyboard

{{Indent}}This skill defaults at -3 to any skill that involves a lot of typing, notably Administration, Computer Operation, Research, and Writing, and Professional Skills such as Journalist. If you have such a skill, Typing skill is redundant (unless you wish to work as a professional typist)
