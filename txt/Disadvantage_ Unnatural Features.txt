|{{Indent}}You are superficially “normal” but have one or more disturbing cosmetic features. To qualify for points, these must be unnatural for your race. Pointed ears and eyes like hot coals would be unnatural for a human, but not for a demon from Hell! You must specify the origin of your Unnatural Features: magical curse, ultra-tech surgery, rare disease, etc.
{{Indent}}Unnatural Features need not be unattractive (if they are, you can also claim points for below-average appearance), but they make it easy for others to identify you and hard for you to blend into a crowd. Each level, to a maximum of five levels, gives -1 to your Disguise and Shadowing skills and +1 to others’ attempts to identify or follow you (including their Observation and Shadowing rolls), unless almost everyone else in the crowd happens to share your features.
