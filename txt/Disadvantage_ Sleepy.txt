{{Indent}}The race's precise schedule is a &quot;special effect.&quot; For instance, a race that sleeps 3/4 of the time might be awake and active for three days straight and then sleep for a full nine days.

{{Indent}}This trait can also represent hibernation. For instance, if a race is awake and active on a human schedule for six months, and then hibernates for two months straight, then on the average, that's equivalent to sleeping 1/2 of the time.
