|{{Indent}}This is the ability to play a particular sport well - perhaps well enough to earn a living. Each sport is a separate Sports skill. Most Sports skills are DX/Average and default to DX-5, but those that put a premium on strength (e.g., rugby) might default to ST-5. Some Sports skills might default to one another or to other skills as well

{{Indent}}Make an IQ-based roll to recall the basic rules of your sport. Detailed knowledge of the full rules governing leagues and tournaments - as would be expected of a coach or referee - is covered by the relevant Games skill (p. 197)

{{Indent}}The GM may rule that certain Sports are useful in combat situations. For instance, Sports (Baseball) might let you use a bat to parry hurled rocks and grenades at (skill/2) + 3, Sports (Bullfighting) might give a Parry equal to (skill/2) + 3 against a slam by a beast that uses a &quot;running head butt,&quot; and you might be able to roll against Sports (Rugby) to hit with a slam
