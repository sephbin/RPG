|{{Indent}}This is the ability to play a musical instrument. With a successful skill roll, you give a competent performance. You must specialize in a particular instrument. Defaults between specialties range from -3 for similar instruments to &quot;no default&quot; for utterly unrelated ones, such as Musical Instrument (Drums) and Musical Instrument (Harp)

{{Indent}}This skill includes the ability to read music in your culture's notation system (if any). Treat different systems as familiarities (see Familiarity, p. 169)
