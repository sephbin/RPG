|{{Indent}}You can see details that would normally be invisible without a magnifying glass or a microscope. Each level increases magnification by a factor of 10: 5 points gives 10x, 10 points gives 100x, and so on. This magnification only applies to objects within 1 foot.

{{Indent}}Level 1 suffices for ordinary forensic investigation. Level 3 (1,000x) is equivalent to the best optical microscopes. Level 5 (100,000x) is comparable to an electron microscope, capable of imaging viruses. Level 6 (1,000,000x) is on par with a scanning- tunneling or atomic force microscope, and can study an object's atomic structure.
