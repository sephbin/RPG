You have better cardiovascular
health than your HT alone would indicate.
This comes in two levels:

''Fit:'' You get +1 to all HT rolls (to
stay conscious, avoid death, resist disease
or poison, etc.). This does not
improve your HT attribute or HTbased
skills! You also recover FP at
twice the normal rate. ''5 points.''

''Very Fit:'' As above, but the bonus to
HT rolls is +2. In addition, you lose FP
at only half the normal rate. ''15 points.''


In both cases, this advantage
applies only to FP lost to exertion,
heat, etc. It has no effect on FP spent
to power psi or magic spells.
