|{{Indent}}You are sensitive to omens, and see hidden significance in such things as the way plants grow, the behavior of animals, and even changes in the weather and the sky. Once per day, you may check the omens. This normally requires at least an hour, but if the GM has something in particular he wants to communicate, he may arbitrarily put it in your path. The GM rolls twice, in secret, when you use this ability: once to determine whether you discover the omen, once to see if you interpret it correctly.

{{Indent}}This ability differs from Precognition (p. 77), which requires no interpretation.

{{Indent}}Discovery: To detect an omen requires a Sense roll. On a success, you discover the omen; on a critical success, you get +5 on the subsequent interpretation roll. On a failure, you find nothing of oracular significance. On a critical failure, the GM lies - he tells you that you have found an omen, but this is, in reality, a product of your own fears or wishes.

{{Indent}}Interpretation: To interpret an omen requires an IQ roll. On a success, the omen is very general; e.g., &quot;an enemy approaches&quot; or &quot;a great power, long dormant, is stirring.&quot; On a critical success, the information is more specific: &quot;you risk the wrath of the king,&quot; &quot;seek out the mage in the tower,&quot; etc. On a failure, the omen is simply too vague to be useful. On a critical failure, you blatantly misinterpret the omen - possibly in a dangerous manner.

{{Indent}}Oracle (Digital): You can analyze &quot;live&quot; data - the Internet, news feeds, etc. - and spot items of hidden mundane significance. Roll against Research skill for discovery and Intelligence Analysis skill for interpretation. To use this ability, you must have access to prodigious quantities of unprocessed data. This trait is especially appropriate for AIs and other Digital Minds. 15 points.

{{Indent}}Inspired: You're extremely gifted. Any successful interpretation roll provides you with specific information, and a critical success brings you an unambiguous vision of the truth. +100%.
