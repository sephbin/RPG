|{{Indent}}You have sharp spines, like those of a porcupine or an echidna, located on strategic parts of your body. This is defensive weaponry, intended to discourage attackers; you cannot use your Spines actively. However, you get a DX-4 roll to hit each foe in close combat with you once per turn, as a free action. Roll at +2 against foes who attacked you from behind. Those who grapple or slam you are hit immediately and automatically - and those who slam you take maximum damage!

{{Indent}}Short Spines: One or two inches long. Do 1d-2 impaling damage. Reach C. 1 point.

{{Indent}}Long Spines: One or two feet long. Do 1d impaling damage. Reach C. 3 points.
