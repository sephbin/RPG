|{{Indent}}This is the study of magical transformations and transmutations. In a magical game world, an alchemist would be able to identify concoctions with magical effects (&quot;elixirs&quot;), such as love potions and healing unguents, and prepare them from suitable ingredients. This is a mechanical process, using the mana inherent in certain things; therefore, those without Magery can learn and use Alchemy, and Magery confers no benefit
