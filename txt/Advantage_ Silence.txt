|{{Indent}}You can move and breathe noiselessly. You get +2 per level to Stealth skill when you are perfectly motionless, or +1 if moving (even in armor, etc.). These bonuses help only in the dark, or against listening devices, blind creatures, and others who must rely on hearing to find you.

{{Indent}}Dynamic: Your ability actively cancels out the sounds you make when you move, or helps them blend in with ambient noise. You enjoy your full Stealth bonus (+2 per level) when moving. +40%.
