|{{Indent}}Any time you start to do something the GM feels is STUPID, he will roll against your IQ. A successful roll means he must warn you: &quot;Hadn't you better think about that?&quot; This advantage lets an impulsive player take the part of a thoughtful character.

{{Indent}}Conscious: Not only does the GM warn you when you're about to do something stupid . . . you can ask him to suggest what would be smart in your current situation. He'll roll secretly against your IQ; the better the roll, the better the advice. +50%.
