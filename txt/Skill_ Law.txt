|{{Indent}}This skill represents knowledge of law codes and jurisprudence. A successful roll lets you remember, deduce, or figure out the answer to a question about the law. Few legal questions have clear-cut answers, however - even an expert will hedge his advice!

{{Indent}}You must specialize. There are two general classes of specialty:

{{Indent}}* The laws of a particular political region (e.g., Canada or France) within a specific field (constitutional, contract, criminal, police, etc.). &lt;i&gt;Examples:&lt;/i&gt; Law (British Criminal), Law (Canadian Constitutional), and Law (U.S. Contract)

{{Indent}}* A specialized body of law not associated with a political region. &lt;i&gt;Examples:&lt;/i&gt; Law (Catholic Canon), Law (International), and Law (Space)

{{Indent}}Specialties within the same region, such as Law (British Criminal) and Law (British Police), or field, such as Law (British Criminal) and Law (French Criminal), default to one another at -4. If both region and field differ, the default is -6 or worse

{{Indent}}In some times and places, a Quick Contest of Law (Criminal) between the defense and prosecution will determine the outcome of a trial. In others, Law functions as an Influence skill (see Influence Rolls, p. 359) used to sway the rulings of the judge

{{Indent}}Law enforcers nearly always have a point or two in Law (Police) for their region. This represents knowledge of &quot;proper procedure&quot; when it comes to arrests, evidence handling, interrogation, etc
