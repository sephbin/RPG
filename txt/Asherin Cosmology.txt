Asherin Cosmology
The Asherin Cosmos is an unusual place. The whole universe is constructed from layers spanning to infinity. Unlike spherical astral bodies, mass, life and magic find equilibrium in their native plane, not directly towards some central mass. In Asherin, gravity is down, and always is down. If the planes werenâ€™t flat, everything would fall off the sides.
Of the infinite planes vertically, the plane that seems to cause the most turmoil for itself is Eorith. Eorith sits between a large expanse of astral planes above it, and countless layers of subterranean planes below it. Eorith sits within a goldlocks zone.  A domain of sublayers that make life possible (with a magic catalyst). Many Eorith Theologians and Philosophers claim that this particular hospitable arrangement is proof that there is more to the universe than animalistic chaos, but lack the tools and existential communication devices to communicate with me to truly find out (which is unfair on my behalf.)
