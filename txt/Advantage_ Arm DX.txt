|{{Indent}}Some of your arms have extra DX relative to the DX of your body. This DX applies only to things done with those arms or hands. It does not affect Basic Speed! If a task requires two or more hands, and they don't have the same DX, use the lowest DX. Combat skills rely on bodily DX, and do not benefit from this DX at all.

{{Indent}}Arm DX costs 12 points per +1 DX for one arm and 16 points per +1 DX for two arms. To raise the DX of three or more arms, buy up overall DX. If you bought your DX with the No Fine Manipulators limitation, apply this limitation to Arm DX as well.
