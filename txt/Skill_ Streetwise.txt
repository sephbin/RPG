|{{Indent}}This is the skill of getting along in rough company. A successful Streetwise roll might let you learn (among other things) where any sort of illegal &quot;action&quot; is; which local cops or bureaucrats can be bought, and for how much; and how to contact the local underworld. Note that you might also be able to get this information by asking a Contact (p. 44). This skill is a measure of your ability to make new connections as needed

{{Indent}}You may substitute an Influence roll against Streetwise for any reaction roll made in an underworld or &quot;bad neighborhood&quot; situation; see Influence Rolls (p. 359)
