|{{Indent}}This is the ability to compose &quot;good&quot; poetry of any type native to your culture, in any language you know. A successful roll lets you write one good poem in an appropriate amount of time (GM's decision). A failed roll might mean that you couldn't get inspired - or that your audience just didn't care for your work (for whatever reason)

{{Indent}}&lt;font color=&quot;#006AFF&quot; size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Modifiers: The time modifiers under Time Spent (p. 346) will often apply; Cultural Familiarity modifiers (p. 23); Language modifiers (p. 23).&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;
