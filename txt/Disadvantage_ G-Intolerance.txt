|{{Indent}}You function well under a narrow range of gravities. For a normal human, the penalties for non-native gravity accrue in increments of 0.2G; see Different Gravity (p. 350). An increment of 0.1G is worth -10 points. An increment of 0.05G is worth -20 points.

{{Indent}}This disadvantage is only allowed in campaigns that feature regular space travel.
