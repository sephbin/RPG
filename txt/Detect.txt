You can detect a specific substance
or condition, even when it is shielded
from the five human senses. This
requires one second of concentration,
after which the GM will secretly make
a Sense roll for you (see Sense Rolls,
p. 358). The range modifiers from the
Size and Speed/Range Table (p. 550)
apply. You may buy a special Acute
Sense (p. 35) to improve the roll,
thereby increasing your effective
range.

On a success, the GM tells you the
direction to the nearest significant
source of the substance, and give you
a clue as to the quantity present. On a
failure, you sense nothing.

Detect also includes the ability to
analyze what you detect. This requires
an IQ roll; the better the roll, the more
precise the details. For instance, if you
had Detect (Metal), you could tell gold
from iron on a successful IQ roll, and
might learn details – such as whether
the gold is in the form of ore or bars,
and its precise purity – on a critical
success.

The base cost of Detect is as
follows:

''Rare'' (sorceresses, fire magic, zombies,
gold, radar, radio): 5 points.
Occasional (spellcasters, magic,
undead, precious metal, electric fields,
magnetic fields, radar and radio): ''10
points.''

''Common'' (humans, supernatural
phenomena, supernatural beings,
metal, electric and magnetic fields): ''20
points.''

''Very Common'' (all life, all supernatural
phenomena and beings, all minerals,
all energy): ''30 points.''

Note that the ability to detect certain
phenomena can often justify
other advantages. For instance, Detect
(Magnetic Fields) could explain
Absolute Direction.

'''Special Enhancements'''

''Precise:'' On a successful Sense roll,
you also learn the distance to whatever
you detect. ''+100%.''

''Signal Detection:'' You can detect an
active transmission of some sort, such
as a radio, radar, or laser; see Scanning
Sense (p. 81) and Telecommunication
(p. 91). You suffer no range penalties,
but must be within twice the signal’s
own range and (if the signal is directional)
within in its path. ''+0%.''

'''Special Limitations'''

''Vague:'' You can only detect the
presence or absence of the target substance.
Direction and quantity are
revealed only on a critical success, and
you cannot analyze what you detect.
This limitation is mutually exclusive
with Precise. ''-50%.''
