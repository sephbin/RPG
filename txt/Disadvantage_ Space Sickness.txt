|{{Indent}}You are miserable in free fall. You can never learn Free Fall skill; you must always roll at default. In addition, you are at -4 on your HT roll to avoid &quot;space adaptation syndrome&quot; (see p. 434) - and if you fail the first HT roll, the only way for you to recover is to return to normal gravity.

{{Indent}}This trait is only allowed in campaigns that feature regular space travel.
