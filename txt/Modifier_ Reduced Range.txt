|{{Indent}}You may add this limitation to any advantage that has a range; e.g., Innate Attack or Scanning Sense. It comes in three levels, depending on the range divisor.

{{Indent}}If applied to a ranged attack that has a 1/2D range, each level reduces both 1/2D and Max. You may reduce 1/2D only at half value (that is, &quot;Reduced 1/2D&quot; is -5%/level). You may not reduce Max independently.
