<div><h2 class='points'>10 points</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You are in tune with spirits, and receive the benefits of Empathy (p. 51) when dealing with them. You can get a feeling for the general intentions of any spirit you encounter by making a successful IQ roll. As well, your Influence skills (Diplomacy, Sex Appeal, etc.) work normally on spirits, which sets you aside from most mortals. Spirit Empathy does not prevent evil or mischievous spirits from seeking to harm you, but at the GM's option, it might make it easier to detect and counter their plots.<br>
