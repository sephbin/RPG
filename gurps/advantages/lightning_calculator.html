<body><div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>LIGHTNING CALCULATOR</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>2 or 5 points</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You have the ability to do math in your head, instantly. This talent comes in two levels:<br>
Lightning Calculator: You, the player, may use a calculator at any time, to figure anything you want - even if your character is fleeing for his life! For simple math problems, the GM may just say that your character knows the answer. 2 points.<br>
Intuitive Mathematician: As above, but your ability is not limited to arithmetic. You can perform astrogation without a computer, do any level of engineering design in your head, and solve differential equations almost instantaneously. You never need a calculator; you yourself are far faster than that, and even faster than many computers. 5 points.<br>
True mathematical geniuses will have one of the above traits and one or more levels of Mathematical Ability (see Talent, p. 89).</p,></div></div></body>
