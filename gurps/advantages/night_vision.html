<div><h2 class='points'>1 point/level</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>Your eyes adapt rapidly to darkness. Each level of this ability (maximum nine levels) allows you to ignore -1 in combat or vision penalties due to darkness, provided there is at least some light.<br>
Example: Night Vision 4 would completely eliminate darkness penalties up to -4, and would reduce a penalty of -7 to only -3.<br>
Regardless of level, Night Vision only works in partial darkness. It has no effect on the -10 for total darkness (for that, get Dark Vision, p. 47).</p,></div></div></body>
