<body><div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>DESTINY</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>Variable</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>Your fate is preordained. This is considered an advantage if you are destined for great things - although this might not always be clear, and might even be inconvenient at times. For a disadvantageous Destiny, see p. 131.<br>
When you choose this advantage, you may only specify its point value. The GM will secretly determine the nature of your Destiny, according to its point value and the dictates of the campaign. You might discover some clues about your Destiny via magical divination or similar techniques, but you are highly unlikely to learn its full extent until it is fulfilled. Note also that a Destiny may change as the campaign develops.<br>
Be aware that this advantage gives the GM absolute license to meddle with your life - the GM must make the Destiny work out! Working out a good Destiny and making sure it comes to pass require considerable ingenuity on the part of the GM. The GM may wish to forbid this advantage if he feels it would send the campaign off the rails.<br>
The point value of the Destiny determines its impact:<br>
Great Advantage: You are fated to achieve greatness within your lifetime. In the end, everyone will know and praise your name! Sooner or later, something will happen to bring this Destiny to fruition. Note that this does not guarantee success. If you choose to jump in front of an assassin's knife during your first game session, the GM might just decide the Destiny is fulfilled . . . you died a hero! 15 points.<br>
Major Advantage: As above, but to a lesser extent. Alternatively, you might be doomed to die in a particular place or in a particular fashion: at sea, by the hand of an emperor, underground, or whatever. You can be grievously wounded - even maimed - under other circumstances, but you will not die. If you avoid the circumstances that would fulfill your Destiny, knowingly or otherwise, you might find that Fate has a few surprises. The sea might flood your home while you sleep, the general against whom you march might be the future emperor, or Mt. Vesuvius might bury you under tons of ash. 10 points.<br>
Minor Advantage: You are fated to play a small part in a larger story, but this part will reflect to your credit. In game terms, you are guaranteed one significant victory. 5 points.</p,></div></div></body>
