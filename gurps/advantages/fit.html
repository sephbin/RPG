<div><p class='card'>You have better cardiovascular health than your HT alone would indicate.<br>
This comes in two levels, In both cases, this advantage applies only to FP lost to exertion, heat, etc. It has no effect on FP spent to power psi or magic spells:<br>
Fit: You get +1 to all HT rolls (to stay conscious, avoid death, resist disease or poison, etc.). This does not improve your HT attribute or HTbased skills! You also recover FP at twice the normal rate. 5 points.<br>
Very Fit: As above, but the bonus to HT rolls is +2. In addition, you lose FP at only half the normal rate. 15 points.</p,></div></div></body>
