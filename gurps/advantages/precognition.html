<body><div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>PRECOGNITION</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>25 points</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You receive glimpses of future events. You cannot control the content of these flashes - you just know that something interesting or important might happen, at some unspecified future date. You might learn this through visions, voices, or sudden knowledge. A vivid premonition of a terrible event might even require a Fright Check (p. 360)!<br>
Precognition only gives information that your future self could learn and that would matter to you. For instance, if you're in New York, you are unlikely to have a premonition about a random murder in Los Angeles. But if the victim was a friend, or if the killing was important enough to make national news, you might flash on it.<br>
Nothing about the future is certain, though. Even if the GM has made up his mind, he could reconsider . . . although something related to the premonition should still happen. In most settings, predicted events will occur unless you take specific action to prevent them. (But the GM is free to rule that the future is immutable in his setting!)<br>
Whenever the GM feels a premonition would be appropriate, he will secretly make an IQ roll for you - usually during an encounter with a person or object. For instance, meeting someone with an important event in his future might set off a premonition related to that event, especially if it would affect you in some way. Similarly, seeing a picture of a place could set off a vision involving that location.<br>
A deliberate attempt to use Precognition requires 10 minutes of concentration, 2 FP, and an IQ roll at -8. You can attempt to read your own future, or that of another person. To deliberately read the future of someone else, you must be able to touch him.<br>
Precognition is normally limited to seeing into the near future - perhaps a week or so. At the GM's option, however, a critical success or a very important event might result in visions from much further in the future.<br>
Note that Precognition includes Danger Sense (p. 47) - do not take both.<br>
Directed: When you deliberately use your ability, you may opt to focus on a specific event involving the subject of your attempt (yourself or someone else). Name the event - e.g., The battle with the Dark Lord - before you roll. On a success, you discover the most likely outcome. Failure means you learn nothing, and critical failure blacks out the event in all future premonitions. Passive use is unchanged. Directed is mutually exclusive with One Event. +100%.<br>

</p><h3 class="card">Special Limitations</h3><p class="card">
Can't See Own Death: Your Precognition cannot detect people or events that the GM believes have a high probability of causing your death. Your ability does not include Danger Sense. -60%.<br>
ESP: Your ability is part of the ESP psi power (see p. 255). -10%.<br>
One Event: Your ability works only for a particular type of event: events involving you personally (if you scanned another, you would only see a significant event if you were involved); disasters; events related to death; events related to love, etc. This limitation is mutually exclusive with Can't See Own Death. -40%.<br>
Active Only: You can only use your gift deliberately - you never receive spontaneous visions. Your ability doesn't include Danger Sense. This is mutually exclusive with Can't See Own Death. -60%.<br>
Passive Only: You can never use your gift deliberately. This is mutually exclusive with Active Only and Directed. -20%.</p,></div></div></body>
