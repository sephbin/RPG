<body><div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>SECURITY CLEARANCE</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>Variable</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>A government agency or corporation trusts you with access to sensitive information that would otherwise be off limits to someone of your Rank or Status. For instance, a general cleared for military secrets commensurate with his Military Rank would not have to buy Security Clearance separately, but a civilian with exactly the same level of access would have to pay points for the privilege.<br>
Point cost depends on your degree of access:<br>
* You have access to a relatively narrow range of secrets on a need to know basis. Example: a strategic bomber pilot, who might know secrets about aircraft, weapons, and targets. 5 points.<br>
* You have either free access to a narrow range of secrets or need to know access to a broad range of secrets. Example: a counterintelligence officer, who would have limited access to many secrets, as part of his job is to protect them. 10 points.<br>
* You have free access to a broad range of secrets. Example: a cinematic secret agent, who will know almost any secret the plot requires him to know. 15 points.<br>
Halve these values (round up) if the organization that grants the Security Clearance is of relatively minor importance (e.g., a small corporation or municipal government).<br>
You cannot receive a security clearance without a thorough background check. The GM is free to forbid this advantage to any PC who has a suspicious past (including such traits as Debt or Secret) or an unstable personality (for instance, Paranoia or Sadism).</p,></div></div></body>
