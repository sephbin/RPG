<body><div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>OBSCURE</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>2 points/level</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You produce an effect that actively jams one particular sense, making it difficult to detect you and everything in your vicinity. You must specify the affected sense. This can be one of the five human senses or a sensory advantage such as Infravision, Radar, or one particular Detect. Examples include Obscure (Vision) for fog, Obscure (Hearing) for white noise, and Obscure (Radar) for electronic jamming.<br>
Obscure affects a two-yard radius centered on you. Add the Area Effect enhancement (p. 102) to increase this radius. The affected sense is at -1 per level of Obscure to detect anything within your radius. Ten levels will block the sense completely. The boundaries of the zone are easily detected by the affected sense, however; roll at +1 per level.<br>
Clairsentience: Obscure usually blocks one sense, whether the observer examines the affected area in person or remotely. A supernatural or superscience anti-power might specifically prevent all remote sensing without affecting any mundane senses. Obscure (Clairsentience) often has Extended for Detect, Divination, or Para-Radar (+20% each) and Limited, Psi (-20%).<br>
Detect: An effect that actively jams a specialized sensor should have Obscure against the equivalent Detect. For instance, Obscure (Detect Magnetic Fields) would work against magnetic anomaly detectors. Other forms of Obscure might affect supernatural versions of Detect - imagine a demon with Obscure (Detect Evil)!<br>
Divination: Obscure (Divination) is legitimate, and affects all attempts to gather facts from within the area through such means as Information spells and Psychometry. Use Obscure (Clairsentience) to disrupt remote viewing.<br>
Hearing: This might represent a magical stealth spell, white noise, or ultra-tech sound cancellation. Regular hearing, Subsonic Hearing, Ultrasonic Hearing, Sonar, and Vibration Sense are all related for the purpose of the Extended enhancement. Obscure (Subsonic Hearing) and (Ultrahearing) suffice to evade geophones and ultrasonic motion detectors, respectively. Discriminatory Hearing, Parabolic Hearing, and so on aren't unique senses; they merely make hearing more useful. Those who have such traits have no special ability to ignore Obscure.<br>
Scanning Sense: Treat Radar and Imaging Radar as the same sense for the purpose of Obscure. Other Scanning Senses require separate versions of Obscure. These varieties of Obscure nearly always represent jamming of some kind. For the purpose of the Extended enhancement, Ladar is related to all kinds of vision, while Sonar is related to Vibration Sense and all types of hearing. In most settings, Para-Radar is related to Clairsentience and Detect.<br>
Vision: This could be darkness, blinding light, fog, smoke, or a magical blurring spell. Regular vision, Infravision, Ultravision, and Ladar are all related for the purpose of the Extended enhancement. Obscure (Infravision) also interferes with heatseeking missiles and infrared motion detectors. Microscopic and Telescopic Vision, Peripheral Vision, etc. aren't unique senses; they just make vision more useful. Those with such advantages have no special ability to ignore Obscure.<br>
Penalties for Obscure also apply to any form of Telecommunication (p. 81) that uses the same type of signal as the blocked senses, if the sender or receiver is inside the area of effect. Infrared Communication works like Infravision, Laser Communication works like Ladar, Radio works like Radar, and so on. It's up to the GM whether Telesend works like Para- Radar.<br>
By default, Obscure is a detectable jamming field (e.g., darkness, electronic noise, or white noise) or cloud (anti-laser aerosol, radar-defeating chaff, smoke, etc.) around the user. Without special modifiers, it impedes signals crossing it in either direction. There are two common exceptions to these assumptions:<br>
Stealth Field: A subtle effect that prevents detection of the user and the field itself is standard for magic and psionics, and common for superscience cloaking. This requires Stealthy (+100%). Supernatural versions rarely inconvenience the user, and also have Defensive (+50%). Ultratech devices generally block the user's sensors, too.<br>
Weapon: Many supers and vehicles shoot beams or projectiles that cause these effects at a distance; e.g., flares for Obscure (Infravision) or smoke bombs for Obscure (Vision). Give such abilities Ranged (+50%). Don't add Stealthy to anything that's supposed to work as a decoy or distraction.<br>

</p><h3 class="card">Special Enhancements</h3><p class="card">
Defensive: You are unaffected by your own Obscure ability. +50%.<br>
Extended: Each related sense (Infravision as well as normal vision, Sonar as well as normal hearing, etc.) blocked beyond the first is +20%.<br>
Ranged: You produce your obscuring effect at a distant point rather than around your body. This is a ranged attack with 1/2D -, Max 100, Acc 3, RoF 1, Shots N/A, and Recoil 1. Duration is 10 seconds. You can apply other modifiers to change these statistics. Unlike the usual Ranged enhancement (p. 107), this modifier lets you use your ability again before its duration has expired (e.g., to simulate multiple smoke grenades); thus, it is more expensive. +50%.<br>
Stealthy: Your ability works invisibly, like a magical zone of silence. There is no bonus to detect the boundaries of your area of effect. +100%.<br>

</p><h3 class="card">Special Limitations</h3><p class="card">
Always On: You cannot turn this ability off. -50%.<br>
Limited: You can only block a sense that occurs as part of a power. An entire power source (e.g., magical or psionic) is -20%; a specific power (e.g., ESP or Telepathy) is -40%.</p,></div></div></body>
