<div><h2 class='points'>5 points</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You are unusually talented at reading the motivations of animals. When you meet an animal, the GM rolls against your IQ and tells you what you feel. This reveals the beast's emotional state - friendly, frightened, hostile, hungry, etc. - and whether it is under supernatural control. You may also use your Influence skills (see p. 359) on animals just as you would on sapient beings, which usually ensures a positive reaction.<br>
This ability frequently accompanies some level of Animal Friend (see Talent, p. 89), and often Sense of Duty (Animals) or Vow (Vegetarianism).</p,></div></div></body>
