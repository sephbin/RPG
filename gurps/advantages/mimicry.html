<div><p class='card'>You can duplicate any simple sound (alarm, gunshot, etc.) by listening to it for one second and making a successful IQ roll. You can also imitate voices by spending at least 10 seconds listening to them - live, recorded, or remotely - and making an IQ roll.<br>
This trait gives you no special ability to stun or deafen others with loud sounds, or to speak unpronounceable magic words. Buy any such capabilities separately.<br>
Voice Library: You never forget any sound or voice you've successfully mimicked. It's the player's job to maintain this list. To recall a sample, take a Concentrate maneuver and make an IQ roll. +50%.</p,></div></div></body>
