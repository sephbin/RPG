<div><h2 class='points'>5 or 15 points</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>Your wounds heal quickly. This trait comes in two levels:<br>
Rapid Healing: Whenever you roll to recover lost HP or to see if you can get over a crippling injury, you get +5 to your effective HT. Prerequisite: HT 10+. 5 points.<br>
Very Rapid Healing: As above, but when you roll to recover lost HT, a successful HT roll means you heal two HP, not one. Prerequisite: HT 12+. 15 points.<br>
Note that this advantage does not hasten recovery from the short-term effects of injury, such as stunning and knockout; get Recovery (p. 80) for that.</p,></div></div></body>
