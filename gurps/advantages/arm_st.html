<body><div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>ARM ST</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>3, 5, or 8 points per +1 ST</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>Some of your arms have extra ST relative to the ST of your body. This ST applies only to efforts to lift, throw, or attack with those arms or hands. It does not affect HP or overall Basic Lift! If a task requires multiple hands, and they don't have the same ST, use the average ST.<br>
Arm ST costs 3 points per +1 ST for one arm, 5 points per +1 ST for two arms, and 8 points per +1 ST for three arms. To raise the ST of four or more arms, buy up overall ST. If you bought your ST with the No Fine Manipulators or Size limitations, apply the same limitation(s) to Arm ST.</p,></div></div></body>
