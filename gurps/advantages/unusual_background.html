<div><h2 class='points'>Variable</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>This is a catch-all trait that the GM can use to adjust the point total of any character with special abilities that are not widely available in the game world. Special abilities might mean cinematic traits, magic spells, exotic advantages (for a human), supernatural advantages (for anyone), or almost anything else - it depends on the setting. Players are free to suggest Unusual Backgrounds to the GM, but the GM decides whether a proposed Unusual Background is acceptable, and if so, what its cost and benefits are.<br>
Example 1: Raised by wizards to justify access to magic spells might be a 0-point special effect in a fantasy world where magic is common, a 10- point Unusual Background in a conspiracy campaign where magic is known but kept secret, and a 50-point Unusual Background - or simply forbidden - in a horror game where a PC who wields supernatural power would reduce the suspense.<br>
Example 2: Daughter of the God of Magic to justify the Unkillable advantage would be an Unusual Background in any setting, and would be worth as much as the advantage itself - 50 points or more - if the GM allowed it at all.<br>
Not every unusual character concept merits an Unusual Background. The GM should only charge points when the character enjoys a tangible benefit. For instance, it would be unusual for a human to be raised by wolves, but unless this gave him special capabilities (such as Speak with Animals), it would be background color, worth 0 points.</p,></div></div></body>
