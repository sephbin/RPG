<div><p class='card'>You can really concentrate! You get +3 to success rolls for any lengthy mental task you concentrate on to the exclusion of other activities, if the GM feels such focus would be beneficial. You tend to ignore everything else while obsessed (roll vs. Will to avoid this), and have -5 to all rolls to notice interruptions.<br>
The GM may rule that certain complex tasks (e.g., inventing, magic, and social activities) require you to divide your attention. This trait has no effect in such situations.</p,></div></div></body>
