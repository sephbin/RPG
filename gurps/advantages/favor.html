<div><h2 class='points'>Variable</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You saved someone's life, kept silent at the right time, or otherwise did someone a good turn. Now he owes you one.<br>
A Favor is a one-shot Ally, Contact, Contact Group, or Patron. Work out the point cost of the parent advantage, and then divide it by 5 (round up) to get the cost of the Favor. The catch is that the NPC(s) in question will help you out once . . . and only once.<br>
When you wish to collect on your Favor, the GM rolls against the frequency of appearance of the underlying advantage. On a failure, you couldn't reach your friend in time, or he couldn't comply, but you still have your Favor coming. You may try again on a later adventure.<br>
On a success, you get what you want (subject to the limits of the advantage). But this discharges the obligation: remove the Favor from your character sheet and reduce your point total appropriately. However, if the roll is a 3 or 4, your friend still feels indebted to you, and you retain the Favor . . . at least until next time.<br>
You may buy a Favor in play, just like any trait of this kind. The GM may also wish to include a Favor as part of the reward for a successful adventure.</p,></div></div></body>
