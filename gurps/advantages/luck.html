<div><h2 class='points'>Variable</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You were born lucky! There are three progressively more cinematic levels of Luck:<br>
Luck: Once per hour of play, you may reroll a single bad die roll twice and take the best of the three rolls! You must declare that you are using your Luck immediately after you roll the dice. Once you or anyone else has made another die roll, it is too late to use Luck. If the GM is rolling in secret (e.g., to see if you notice something), you may tell him you are using your Luck ahead of time, and he must roll three times and give you the best result. 15 points.<br>
Extraordinary Luck: As above, but usable every 30 minutes. 30 points.<br>
Ridiculous Luck: As above, but usable every 10 minutes! 60 points.<br>
Your Luck only applies to your own success, damage, or reaction rolls, or on outside events that affect you or your whole party, or when you are being attacked (in which case you may make the attacker roll three times and take the worst roll!).<br>
You cannot share Luck. If Strong Sam is trying to kick open a door, Lucky Lou can't stand behind him and transfer his Luck. He'll have to kick that door himself.<br>
Once you use Luck, you must wait an hour of real time (30 minutes for Extraordinary Luck, 10 minutes for Ridiculous Luck) before using it again. You cannot use Luck at 11:58 and then again at 12:01. And you cannot save up Luck. You cannot play for hours without using Luck and then use it several times in a row!<br>
Wishing: You can consciously manipulate probability. You may request two rerolls for any die roll made in your presence - not just your rolls - and choose the one you prefer. It isn't enough for you, the player to see the dice roll; your character must witness the action you wish to influence. Normal usage limits still apply. The Active limitation is common but not required. +100%.<br>
Active: Your Luck is a conscious supernatural power. You must declare that you are using it before you roll the dice. It cannot be used after the fact to reroll a bad result. -40%.<br>
Aspected: Your Luck applies only to one specific class of related tasks, such as athletics, social interactions, or skills you use at your job. Combat is a valid choice, but it only affects weapon skill rolls, active defenses, and ST or DX rolls for close combat - not DX rolls to avoid tripping, HT rolls to survive, etc. -20%.<br>
Defensive: You can only use your Luck to reroll failed active defense rolls, resistance rolls, or HT rolls to resist the effects of injury, or to make an opponent reroll a critical hit against you. -20%.</p,></div></div></body>
