<div><p class='card'>You have a superhuman ability to distinguish between sounds. You can always identify people by voice, and can recognize individual machines by their sound signature. You may memorize a sound by listening to it for at least one minute and making a successful IQ roll. On a failure, you must wait at least one full day before making a repeated attempt.<br>
You get +4 (in addition to any Acute Hearing bonuses) on any task that utilizes hearing, and receive +4 to Shadowing skill when following a noisy target.<br>
To simulate the passive sonar used by submarines, add a -30% Accessibility limitation, Only underwater.<br>
Profiling: You possess an extensive mental database of sensory signatures that you can quickly compare to new sensory impressions. This doubles the bonus to analyze and recognize targets (but not to sense or track them) to +8. As a side benefit, all attempts to memorize new signatures succeed automatically - there's no need for an IQ roll. +50%.</p,></div></div></body>
