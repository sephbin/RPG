<div><p class='card'>You are a natural inventor. You can modify existing equipment and - given sufficient time and money - invent entirely new gadgets as described under Gadgeteering (p. 475). This lets you design gadgets quickly, and makes it easy to realize higher-TL innovations. This advantage comes in two levels:<br>
Gadgeteer: You are a cinematic gadgeteer, but your work still takes days or months, and requires a good deal of money and expensive equipment. 25 points.<br>
Quick Gadgeteer: You can throw together wondrous gadgets in minutes or hours, and can get by with scrounged-together spare parts that cost a few percent of what a realistic inventor would have to spend. This level is definitely unsuitable for realistic campaigns! 50 points.</p,></div></div></body>
