<body><div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>360° VISION</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>25 points</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You have a 360° field of vision. You have no penalty to defend against attacks from the sides or rear. You can attack foes to your sides or rear without making a Wild Swing, but you are at -2 to hit due to the clumsy angle of attack (note that some Karate techniques do not suffer this penalty). Finally, you are at +5 to detect Shadowing attempts, and are never surprised by a danger that comes from behind, unless it also is concealed from sight.<br>
Extra eyes are merely a special effect of this trait - you can have any number of eyes, but the point cost remains the same.<br>
<hr>
</p><h3 class="card">Special Enhancements</h3><p class="card">
Panoptic 1: You can see all around you without turning your head and without the need for extra eyes. This is an enhancement because your gift isn't obvious - you can visibly stare in one direction and actually be looking in another! You still need eyes, though. If you're blindfolded, dazzled, blinded by injuries, etc., you cannot see. +20%.<br>
Panoptic 2: As above, but you don't need eyes. You can always perceive everything going on around you, even if blinded or blindfolded. You still need light, unless you have something like Dark Vision. Blows to the eyes injure you normally but won't blind this sense. +60%.<br>
<hr>
</p><h3 class="card">Special Limitations</h3><p class="card">
Easy to Hit: Your eyes are on stalks, unusually large, or otherwise more vulnerable to attack. Others can target your eyes from within their arc of vision at only -6 to hit. -20%.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>ABSOLUTE DIRECTION</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>5 or 10 points</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You have an excellent sense of direction. This ability comes in two levels:<br>
Absolute Direction: You always know which way is north, and you can always retrace a path you have followed within the past month, no matter how faint or confusing. This ability does not work in environments such as interstellar space or the limbo of the astral plane, but it does work underground, underwater, and on other planets. This gives +3 to Body Sense and Navigation (Air, Land, or Sea). (Note: The navigational sense that guides migratory creatures to their destination is too crude to qualify; treat it as a 0-point feature.) 5 points.<br>
3D Spatial Sense: As above, but works in three dimensions. This ability is useful in deep space - although it does not help you if you travel across dimensions. You get the skill bonuses given for Absolute Direction, plus +1 to Piloting and +2 to Aerobatics, Free Fall, and Navigation (Hyperspace or Space). 10 points.<br>
<hr>
</p><h3 class="card">Special Limitations</h3><p class="card">
Requires Signal: You rely on signals from a navigational satellite network (like Earth's GPS) or similar system. Your ability does not function in the absence of such a system, and it can be jammed. -20%.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>ABSOLUTE TIMING</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>2 or 5 points</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You have an accurate mental clock. This ability comes in two levels, both of which are somewhat cinematic:<br>
Absolute Timing: You always know what time it is, with a precision equal to the best personal timepieces widely available in your culture (but never better than a few seconds). You can measure elapsed time with equal accuracy. Neither changes of time zone nor sleep interferes with this ability, and you can wake up at a predetermined time if you choose. Being knocked unconscious, hypnotized, etc. may prevent this advantage from working, and time travel will confuse you until you find out what the new time is. 2 points.<br>
Chronolocation: As above, but time travel does not interfere - you always know what time it is in an absolute sense. Note that things like Daylight Savings Time and calendar reform can still confuse you! When you travel in time, the GM may tell you, You have gone back exactly 92,876.3 days, and let you - or your character - deal with questions like, What about leap year? 5 points.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>Accessory</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>1 point</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>Your body incorporates a tool or other useful gadget (e.g., a siren or a vacuum cleaner) that provides minor, noncombat benefits not otherwise covered by a specific advantage. </p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>ACUTE SENSES</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>2 points/level</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You have superior senses. Each Acute Sense is a separate advantage that gives +1 per level to all Sense rolls (p. 358) you make - or the GM makes for you - using that one sense.<br>
With the GM's permission, you may also buy Acute Sense advantages for specialized senses such as Scanning Sense and Vibration Sense.<br>
You cannot usually buy Acute Senses in play - raise your Perception instead. However, if you lose a sense, the GM may allow you to spend earned points on other Acute Senses to compensate. For instance, if you are blinded, you might acquire Acute Hearing.<br>
Acute Hearing gives you a bonus to hear something, or to notice a sound (for instance, someone taking the safety off a gun in the dark). 2 points/level.<br>
Acute Taste and Smell gives you a bonus to notice a taste or smell (for instance, poison in your drink). 2 points/level.<br>
Acute Touch gives you a bonus to detect something by touch (for instance, a concealed weapon when patting down a suspect). 2 points/level.<br>
Acute Vision gives you a bonus to spot things visually, and whenever you do a visual search (for instance, looking for traps or footprints). 2 points/level.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>AFFLICTION</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>10 points/level</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You have an attack that causes a baneful, nondamaging effect: blindness, paralysis, weakness, etc. This might be an ultra-tech beam weapon, a chemical spray, a supernatural gaze attack, or almost anything else. Specify the details when you buy the advantage.<br>
By default, Affliction is a ranged attack with 1/2D 10, Max 100, Acc 3, RoF 1, Shots N/A, and Recoil 1, although you can apply modifiers to change these statistics (see pp. 101- 116).<br>
If you hit, your victim gets a HT+1 roll to resist. Apply a penalty equal to the level of the Affliction (so Affliction 1 gives an unmodified HT roll). The victim gets a bonus equal to his DR unless the Affliction has one of the following modifiers: Blood Agent, Contact Agent, Cosmic, Follow-Up, Malediction, Respiratory Agent or Sense-Based. To reduce the effects of DR, add the Armor Divisor enhancement. The victim gets a further +3 if he is beyond 1/2D range.<br>
If the victim makes his HT roll, he is unaffected. If he fails, he suffers the effects of the Affliction. By default, he is stunned (see p. 420). He may roll vs. HT+1 once per second to recover, but once again at a penalty equal to the level of the Affliction (DR has no effect on this roll).<br>
If your Affliction causes an effect other than stunning, this is a special enhancement (see below). You can inflict more than one effect by giving your Affliction multiple special enhancements. These effects occur simultaneously, except where noted.<br>
Successive Afflictions that produce the same effects are not normally cumulative. Use the single worst effect.<br>
Use the </p><h3 class="card">Special Enhancements</h3><p class="card"> below to create specific Afflictions. Many Attack Enhancements and Limitations (p. 102) are also logical. For instance, a blinding flash is Sense- Based (p. 109); most drugs have Follow-Up (p. 105), Blood Agent (p. 102), or Contact Agent (p. 103); supernatural attacks like the evil eye use Malediction (p. 106); and touch attacks call for Melee Attack (p. 112).<br>
If an Affliction produces two or more effects due to the special enhancements below, some of these effects may be secondary. Secondary effects occur only if the victim fails his HT roll by 5 or more or rolls a critical failure. A secondary effect is worth 1/5 as much; e.g., Secondary Heart Attack is +60% rather than +300%.<br>
Once you have chosen all the modifiers on your Affliction, describe the nature of the attack as detailed for Innate Attack (p. 61).<br>
<hr>
</p><h3 class="card">Special Enhancements</h3><p class="card">
Advantage: The victim immediately experiences the effects of a specific physical or mental advantage. Advantages with instantaneous effects affect the target once, as soon as he is hit, if he fails his HT roll; e.g., Warp immediately teleports the subject. Advantages that can be switched on and off (such as Insubstantiality) are automatically on for one minute per point by which the victim fails his HT roll, and are not under the subject's control. This is worth +10% per point the advantage is worth; e.g., Insubstantiality would be +800%! If the advantage comes in levels, specify the level.<br>
Attribute Penalty: The victim suffers temporary attribute loss. This is +5% per -1 to ST or HT, or +10% per -1 to DX or IQ. For instance, an attack that caused DX-3 and IQ-2 would be +50%. Lower all skills based on reduced attributes by a like amount. ST penalties also reduce BL and damage, while IQ reductions also apply to Will and Perception. Secondary characteristics are not otherwise affected; for instance, HT reduction does not affect Basic Speed or FP. Penalties last for one minute per point by which the victim fails his HT roll.<br>
Coma: The victim collapses, profoundly unconscious, and will likely die in days unless treated; see Mortal Conditions (p. 429). +250%.<br>
Cumulative: Repeated attacks are cumulative! You must take this in conjunction with Attribute Penalty, or with an Advantage, Disadvantage, or Negated Advantage Enhancement that inflicts a leveled trait. +400%.<br>
Disadvantage: The victim temporarily gains one or more specific physical or mental disadvantages (but not self-imposed mental disadvantages - see p. 121). This is worth +1% per point the temporary disadvantages are worth; e.g., Paranoia [-10] is worth +10%. If a disadvantage comes in levels, specify the level. The disadvantages last for one minute per point by which the victim fails his HT roll.<br>
Heart Attack: The victim suffers an incapacitating heart attack, and will die in minutes unless treated; see Mortal Conditions (p. 429). +300%.<br>
Incapacitation: The victim is incapacitated for a number of minutes equal to the margin of failure on his HT roll. After that, he is stunned until he can make a HT roll (roll once per second). If you combine Incapacitation with other effects (such as Irritant), those effects occur after the Incapacitation wears off; they replace the stunning and last for the same length of time the Incapacitation did. Incapacitation can take the form of any of the following: Daze, +50%; Hallucinating, +50%; Retching, +50%; Agony, +100%; Choking, +100%; Ecstasy, +100%; Seizure, +100%; Paralysis, +150%; Sleep, +150%; or Unconsciousness, +200%. See Incapacitating Conditions (p. 428) for the game effects.<br>
Irritant: The victim suffers an impairing but non-incapacitating condition instead of being stunned. It lasts for a number of minutes equal to the margin of failure on his HT roll. The possibilities are Tipsy +10%; Coughing, +20%; Drunk, +20%; Moderate Pain, +20%; Euphoria, +30%; Nauseated, +30%; Severe Pain, +40%; or Terrible Pain, +60%. For definitions, see Irritating Conditions (p. 428).<br>
Negated Advantage: The victim loses a specific advantage for one minute per point by which he failed his HT roll. There is no effect if the victim lacks that advantage! This enhancement is worth +1% per point the advantage is worth. If the advantage comes in levels, you must specify the level negated.<br>
Stunning: May only accompany Advantage, Attribute Penalty, Disadvantage, or Negated Advantage. If the victim fails to resist, he is stunned (per an unmodified Affliction) in addition to the effects of the other enhancement(s). +10%.<br>
Beam: A ranged attack that affects one target; e.g., a paralysis beam or a shrinking ray. This is the most basic form of Affliction. It's especially suitable for supers, gods, and ultra-tech beam weapons. Roll against Innate Attack (Beam) to hit.<br>
Curse: Fantasy and horror Afflictions are more often spells than bolts of power, with the attacker calling upon supernatural forces to weaken or incapacitate his foe. The only requirement is Malediction 1 (+100%). To simulate the spells on pp. B242-253, add suitable levels of Costs Fatigue (-5%/level) and Takes Extra Time (-10%/level). Most mental effects are Based on Will (+20%). There's never any roll to hit; Maledictions use a Will roll instead.<br>
Field: The user constantly emits a baneful effect; e.g., a demon might cause those who approach too closely to suffer Agony (+100%). If he affects everyone around him once, when they first come within range, take Area Effect (+50%/level) and Emanation (-20%). If he automatically attacks anyone he touches or who touches him each time he makes contact, use Aura (+80%) and Melee Attack (-30%) instead. In either case, add Always On. This is a -10% limitation, as Afflictions are socially inconvenient but not physically troublesome for the user. No roll to hit is required, but those with Aura can actively try to affect a victim by making a melee attack.<br>
Gas: Sleeping gas, paralysis gas, and the like. Such Afflictions have Area Effect (+50%/level) and one of Respiratory Agent (+50%), Blood Agent (+100%), or Contact Agent (+150%). For a mobile gas cloud, add Drifting (+20%) and Persistent (+40%). A gas that surrounds the attacker has Emanation (-20%) instead. Insidious gases have No Signature (+20%) and possibly Onset (variable). There's no roll to hit; gas has a chance of affecting everyone exposed to it.<br>
Gaze: A gaze is a common vehicle for supernatural Afflictions. For instance, a hypnotic gaze might cause the target to sleep. If the gaze works on any target the attacker can see, it has the Vision-Based enhancement (+150%). Roll against Innate Attack (Gaze) to hit. Gaze attacks by fantasy monsters tend to be short-ranged and curse-like; apply Malediction 1 (+100%) and the Vision-Based limitation (-20%) instead. To affect the target, make the usual Will roll for Malediction.<br>
Mental Blast: Direct mind-to-mind attacks that stun or daze are common psi abilities. Such Afflictions have Malediction 2 (+150%) and Based on Will (+20%). If the attack is totally undetectable, add No Signature (+20%). As with all Maledictions, the only roll required is a Will roll.<br>
Sensory Attack: Some Afflictions affect everyone nearby though their senses. Such attacks have Area Effect (+50%/level) and Emanation (-20%). Bright flashes are Vision-Based (+150%), with a Disadvantage enhancement that inflicts Blindness (+50%); howls, thunderclaps, etc., are Hearing-Based (+150%), and cause Deafness (+20%). As with gas, no roll to hit is necessary - everyone in the area is exposed.<br>
Touch: Monsters, wizards, and supers often have to touch those they wish to afflict. The simplest form of this is Melee Attack (-30%). Attacks that must touch bare skin or an open wound have Contact Agent (-30%) or Blood Agent (-40%), respectively, while supernatural attacks that bypass DR get Malediction 1 (+100%). Make an unarmed melee attack to hit. For Malediction, roll the Quick Contest to see if the Affliction works only after scoring a hit.<br>
Venom: Toxins often cause weakness, paralysis, unconsciousness, coma, or heart attack. Those borne on fangs, claws, etc. have Follow-Up (+0%), while poisonous spray or spit has Contact Agent (-30%) or Blood Agent (-40%). Many poisons take time to work; if so, add Onset (variable). Make a melee attack to hit with a natural weapon. Roll against Innate Attack (Breath) to hit with spray or spit.<br>
Negated Disadvantage: The victim loses a specific disadvantage for one minute per point by which he fails his HT roll. If he lacks that disadvantage, there's no effect. This is worth +10% per point the disadvantage is worth. If the disadvantage comes in levels, specify the level negated.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>ALCOHOL TOLERANCE</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>1 point</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>Your body metabolizes alcohol with remarkable efficiency. You can drink steadily for an indefinite period with no major detrimental effects. Binging affects you as it would anyone else. You get +2 on all HT rolls related to drinking.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>ALLIES</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>Variable</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>Many fictional heroes have partners - loyal comrades, faithful sidekicks, trusted retainers, or lifelong friends - who accompany them on adventures. These partners are Allies.<br>
The other PCs in your adventuring party are, in a sense, allies. But they can be unreliable allies indeed. Often they are chance acquaintances, first encountered at a roadside tavern only hours ago. They have their own hidden goals, ethics, and motives, which might not coincide with your own.<br>
An NPC Ally, on the other hand, is wholly reliable. Perhaps you fought side by side in a long war, trained under the same master, or grew up in the same village. The two of you trust each other implicitly. You travel together, fight back-to-back, share rations in hard times, and trade watches through the night.<br>
Your Ally is usually agreeable to your suggestions, but he is not your puppet. He will disagree with you from time to time. An Ally may try to dissuade you from a plan that seems foolish to him - and if he can't talk you out of the plan, he may refuse to cooperate. An Ally may even cause problems for you: picking fights, landing in jail, insulting a high noble . . . Of course, the Ally will also try to bail you out when you make mistakes.<br>
The GM will not award you bonus character points for any play session in which you betray, attack, or unnecessarily endanger your Ally. Blatant, prolonged, or severe betrayal will break the trust between you and your Ally, and he will leave you permanently. If you drive your Ally off in this way, the points you spent on him are gone, reducing your point value. Leading your Ally into danger is all right, as long as you face the same danger and are a responsible leader.<br>
The point cost for an Ally depends on his power and frequency of appearance. Only PCs who take NPCs as Allies pay points for the privilege. Two PCs can be mutual allies for free, as can two NPCs - and NPCs never pay points for PCs as Allies. An Ally is specifically a skilled NPC associate for one PC.<br>
<hr>
Ally's Power<br>
Consult the following table to determine how many points you must spend on your Ally. Point Total is the Ally's point total expressed as a percentage of the PC's starting points; Cost is the cost of the Ally. If the Ally's point total falls between two percentages, use the higher.<br>
{style=width:300px; background-color: #e8ffe7; margin: auto; border-collapse:collapse; text-align:center;<br>
!Point TotalCost<br>
 style=background-color: #ffffff;<br>

50%2 points<br>
 style=background-color: #ffffff;<br>
75%3 points<br>
100%5 points<br>
 style=background-color: #ffffff;<br>
150%10 points<br>
Allies built on more than 150% of the PC's starting points are not allowed; treat such NPCs as Patrons (see p. 72). Exception: The progression above extends indefinitely for nonsentient (IQ 0) Allies; each +50% of the PC's starting points costs a further +5 points. Allies built on no more than 100% of the PC's starting points may also be Dependents (see p. 131). Add the cost of Ally and Dependent together, and treat the combination as a single trait: an advantage if the total point cost is positive, a disadvantage if it is negative.<br>
<hr>
Ally Groups<br>
You may purchase as many Allies as you can afford. Each Ally is normally a separate advantage, but you can treat a group of related Allies as a single trait to save space on your character sheet. For a group of individuals - with their own unique abilities and character sheets - add the costs of the individual Allies to find the cost of the group, adjust the total cost for frequency of appearance, and then apply any special modifiers.<br>
For a group of more than five identical and interchangeable allies that share a single character sheet - for instance, an army of low-grade thugs or a swarm of robot drones - find the point cost to have one member of the group as an Ally, and then multiply that cost as follows to find the cost of the group:<br>
{style=width:300px; background-color: #e8ffe7; margin: auto; border-collapse:collapse; text-align:center;<br>
!Size of GroupMultiplier<br>
 style=background-color: #ffffff;<br>

11-20x8<br>
 style=background-color: #ffffff;<br>
21-50x10<br>
51-100x12<br>
Add x6 to the multiplier per tenfold increase in number (e.g., 100,000 Allies would be x30). The GM may require an Unusual Background (p. 96) if you wish to have hordes of Allies, or even prohibit groups larger than a certain size - although he might permit an army or other large group as a Patron. Frequency of appearance multipliers and special modifiers (if any) apply to the final cost of the entire group.<br>
<hr>
Frequency of Appearance<br>
Choose a frequency of appearance (see p. 36). If your Ally appears at the start of an adventure, he accompanies you for the duration of that adventure.<br>
Whether you pay points for a useful relationship with an NPC or collect points for a troublesome one, it is unlikely that the NPC will be a constant presence. Each friend or foe has a frequency of appearance, and will figure into a given adventure only if the GM rolls less than or equal to that number on 3d at the start of the adventure. How the NPC interacts with you if the roll succeeds depends on the nature of the relationship.<br>
Frequency of appearance multiplies the point cost for an Associated NPC (see p. 31) after determining power level and group size (as applicable), but before you apply any special modifiers:<br>
Constantly (no roll required): x4. The NPC is always present. This level is reserved for NPCs - usually Allies - that are implanted, worn like clothing, or supernaturally attached.<br>
Almost all the time (roll of 15 or less): x3.<br>
Quite often (roll of 12 or less): x2.<br>
Fairly often (roll of 9 or less): x1.<br>
Quite rarely (roll of 6 or less): x1/2 (round up).<br>
<hr>
Allies in Play<br>
As with Dependents (p. 131), the GM will adjust your Ally's abilities in order to keep his point total a fixed percentage of your own as you earn points. This will keep his value as an advantage constant. The GM decides how the Ally evolves, although he might ask you for your input.<br>
If your Ally dies through no fault of yours, the GM will not penalize you. You may put the points spent on the deceased Ally toward a new Ally. The new relationship should normally develop gradually, but the GM might allow an NPC to become an Ally on the spot if you have done something that would win him over (e.g., saving his life). This is especially appropriate in cultures where debts of honor are taken seriously!<br>
There is no penalty for amicably parting ways with your Ally. You may use the points spent on him to buy a new Ally met during play. At the GM's discretion, you may trade in any remaining points for money (see p. 26), reflecting parting gifts.<br>
<hr>
Familiars<br>
Wizards, telepaths, and so on are often supernaturally linked to special Allies known as familiars. These are usually animals or spirits.<br>
Work out a familiar's basic abilities with the GM, starting with the racial template of an ordinary creature of its kind. If its racial IQ is 5 or less, raise it to at least 6. Consider buying off Cannot Speak, if applicable. Most familiars have supernatural advantages: Extra Lives for a cat (it has nine lives, after all!), Mindlink and Telesend for a familiar that can transmit its thoughts, etc.<br>
Once you have determined the familiar's abilities, work out its point total and its base value as an Ally. Select frequency of appearance as usual. This may be how often your familiar is available (on a failed appearance roll, it is sleeping, reporting to a demon lord, etc.) or how often its powers work (on a failure, it is no more capable than an ordinary member of its species, and cannot use or grant special powers) - your choice.<br>
This kind of Ally usually has one or more special modifiers. Minion, Summonable, and Sympathy are common. Unwilling is typical of demonic or otherwise evil familiars. Take Special Abilities only if your familiar grants you powers; e.g., extra Fatigue Points with which to fuel spells or exotic or supernatural advantages that emulate the familiar's own abilities (such as Flight, for a bird). You have no access to these abilities on a failed appearance roll; if your familiar is stunned, unconscious, or dead; or in areas where your special link does not function (GM's decision). Buy these abilities with a -40% Accessibility limitation: Granted by familiar.<br>
You can apply the following enhancements and limitations after calculating group cost (if applicable) and multiplying for frequency of appearance:<br>
<hr>
</p><h3 class="card">Special Enhancements</h3><p class="card">
Minion: Your Ally continues to serve you regardless of how well you treat him. This might be due to programming, fear, awe, or lack of selfawareness. Examples include robots, zombies, and magical slaves. You are free of the usual obligation to treat your Ally well. Mistreatment might result in an inconvenient breakdown (mental or physical), but the Ally will not leave. See Puppet (p. 78) for additional options. +0% if the Minion has IQ 0 or Slave Mentality (p. 154), as the benefits of total loyalty are offset by the need for close supervision; +50% otherwise.<br>
Special Abilities: Your Ally wields power out of proportion to his point value. Perhaps he has extensive political clout or access to equipment from a TL higher than your own; perhaps he grants you exotic powers. Don't apply this enhancement simply because your Ally has exotic abilities. If his powers are very uncommon, you will already be paying extra: your Ally requires an Unusual Background, which raises his point total and his value as an Ally. +50%.<br>
Summonable: You conjure your Ally instead of rolling to see whether he appears at the start of an adventure. To do so, take a Concentrate maneuver and roll against frequency of appearance. On a success, your Ally appears nearby. On a failure, you cannot attempt to summon him again for one full day. Dismissing your Ally is a free action, but you may only dismiss him if he is physically present. +100%.<br>
<hr>
</p><h3 class="card">Special Limitations</h3><p class="card">
Sympathy: If you are stunned, knocked out, mind-controlled, etc., your Ally is similarly affected. The reverse is also true, so you should take special care of your Ally! -25% if the death of one party reduces the other to 0 HP; -50% if the death of one party automatically kills the other. If your wounds affect your Ally, but your Ally's wounds don't affect you, reduce these values to -5% and -10%.<br>
Unwilling: You have obtained your Ally through coercion (e.g., blackmail or magical binding). You do not have to treat him as well as you would a normal Ally. However, he hates you and is likely to act accordingly, reducing his overall reliability level. If you endanger such an Ally or order him to do something unpleasant, he may rebel (GM's option) if the consequences of doing so would be less severe than those of doing your bidding. An Ally who rebels is gone, along with the points you spent on him. -50%.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>ALTERED TIME RATE</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>100 points/level</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>Your rate of time perception is faster than that of a normal human. The first level of this advantage lets you experience time twice as fast as a normal - that is, you experience two subjective seconds for each real second that passes. Each level past the first increases this ratio by one: three times as fast at level 2, four times as fast at level 3, and so on.<br>
Each level of Altered Time Rate lets you take one additional maneuver on your turn in combat, allowing you to cast spells quickly by taking multiple Concentrate maneuvers, run very fast by taking multiple Move maneuvers, etc. Your turn doesn't come any sooner, however! This advantage affects how fast you move when you react, but not how quickly you react in the first place.<br>
Out of combat, Altered Time Rate allows you the luxury of extensive planning, even in crisis situations, as everything seems to happen in slow motion. You may always attempt a Sense roll, or an IQ-based skill roll to make plans or recall information (GM's decision), at no penalty to additional actions.<br>
<hr>
</p><h3 class="card">Special Enhancements</h3><p class="card">
Super-Speed: You're even faster out of combat! When performing mundane or repetitive tasks - building things (including new inventions), reading, making repairs, etc. - look up your ATR level in the Size column of the Size and Speed/Range Table (p. B550) and divide the time required by the number in the Linear Measurement column. For example, ATR 6 gives a divisor of 20, which means a repair that normally requires an hour takes you just three minutes. You can reduce time further by taking a skill penalty (see p. B346). You can't hasten learning, special abilities (making magic items, concentrating on Mind Control, etc.), Concept rolls when inventing, or interactions with people or machines incapable of matching your speed. The GM may wish restrict Super-Speed to superheroic speedsters. +20%. <br>
<hr>
</p><h3 class="card">Special Limitations</h3><p class="card">
Non-Combat Speed: You enjoy the benefits of Super-Speed out of combat, but get no additional maneuvers in combat. You can buy some of your ATR with Super-Speed and the rest with this limitation. -60%.</p,></div></div>

Each time you purchase this trait, your fingerprints (or other biometrics used to verify identity in your world) are registered under another name, and you have an extra set of identity documents (birth certificate, licenses, passport, etc.) good enough to pass close inspection. These identities may also have valid credit cards and bank accounts, but you must supply the money - additional wealth is not included in the package!<br>
If an intelligence or law-enforcement agency attempts to identify you with no clue as to your name - for instance, using biometrics or photoanalysis - there is an equal chance for each of your identities to come up. The search will stop . . . unless they have reason to believe you are a ringer. If the search continues, your other identities will eventually surface, and you will be unmasked. Once a government agency determines who you really are, your Alternate Identities are lost for good.<br>
There are two types of Alternate Identity:<br>
Legal: Some spies and undercover policemen - and even supers, in settings where they are backed by the government - may have a legal Alternate Identity. This requires at least 10 points in Legal Enforcement Powers, Legal Immunity, Police Rank, Security Clearance, etc.; the GM sets the precise prerequisites. If a super has official permission to conceal his original name (e.g., to protect his family) and to hold property in his super name, then that is a legal Alternate Identity combined with a Secret Identity (see p. 153). 5 points.<br>
Illegal: A criminal or foreign agent may have an illegal Alternate Identity. This has the advantage of being completely unknown when you first start out, and of course it cannot be revoked by the government. On the other hand, should it ever be discovered, you will face a stiff fine, a jail sentence, or execution, depending on the time and place. 15 points.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>AMBIDEXTERITY</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>5 points</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You can fight or otherwise act equally well with either hand, and never suffer the -4 DX penalty for using the off hand (see p. 14). Note that this does not allow you to take extra actions in combat - that's Extra Attack (p. 53). Should some accident befall one of your arms or hands, assume it is the left one.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>AMPHIBIOUS</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>10 points</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You are well-adapted to movement in the water. You do not suffer skill penalties for working underwater, and you can swim at your full Basic Move. You still require air (but see Doesn't Breathe, p. 49). Typical features include smooth, seal-like skin and webbed fingers and toes.<br>
If you can move only in the water, take the Aquatic disadvantage (p. 145) instead.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>ANIMAL EMPATHY</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>5 points</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You are unusually talented at reading the motivations of animals. When you meet an animal, the GM rolls against your IQ and tells you what you feel. This reveals the beast's emotional state - friendly, frightened, hostile, hungry, etc. - and whether it is under supernatural control. You may also use your Influence skills (see p. 359) on animals just as you would on sapient beings, which usually ensures a positive reaction.<br>
This ability frequently accompanies some level of Animal Friend (see Talent, p. 89), and often Sense of Duty (Animals) or Vow (Vegetarianism).</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>ARM DX</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>12 or 16 points per +1 DX</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>Some of your arms have extra DX relative to the DX of your body. This DX applies only to things done with those arms or hands. It does not affect Basic Speed! If a task requires two or more hands, and they don't have the same DX, use the lowest DX. Combat skills rely on bodily DX, and do not benefit from this DX at all.<br>
Arm DX costs 12 points per +1 DX for one arm and 16 points per +1 DX for two arms. To raise the DX of three or more arms, buy up overall DX. If you bought your DX with the No Fine Manipulators limitation, apply this limitation to Arm DX as well.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>ARM ST</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>3, 5, or 8 points per +1 ST</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>Some of your arms have extra ST relative to the ST of your body. This ST applies only to efforts to lift, throw, or attack with those arms or hands. It does not affect HP or overall Basic Lift! If a task requires multiple hands, and they don't have the same ST, use the average ST.<br>
Arm ST costs 3 points per +1 ST for one arm, 5 points per +1 ST for two arms, and 8 points per +1 ST for three arms. To raise the ST of four or more arms, buy up overall ST. If you bought your ST with the No Fine Manipulators or Size limitations, apply the same limitation(s) to Arm ST.</p,></div></div>

<div><h2 class='points'>1 point</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You can enter a trance at will. This requires one minute of complete concentration and a successful Will roll, at -1 per additional attempt per hour. This trance gives +2 on rolls to contact spirits, etc. You must make a Will roll to break your trance. If you fail, you can try again every five minutes.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>BINDING</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>2 points/level</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You have an attack that can hold your target in place. Specify how this works when you buy the advantage: entangling your victim in vines, tying him up with webs, freezing him inside a block of ice, turning the ground to quicksand beneath his feet, etc.<br>
Binding is a ranged attack with 1/2D -, Max 100, Acc 3, RoF 1, Shots N/A, and Recoil 1. You can add modifiers to change these statistics (see pp. 101-116).<br>
On a hit, your victim is grappled (see p. 370) and rooted in place. He cannot select the Move or Change Posture maneuvers or change facing, and is at -4 to DX. The ST of this effect is equal to your Binding level, but you can layer additional attacks on a successfully bound victim. Each extra layer gives +1 to ST. To break free, the victim must win a Quick Contest of ST or Escape skill against the ST of your Binding. Each attempt takes one second. If the victim fails to break free, he loses 1 FP but may try again. Alternatively, he may try to destroy the Binding. Innate Attacks hit automatically; other attacks are at -4. External attacks on the Binding take no penalty, but risk hitting the victim on a miss (see Striking Into a Close Combat, p. 392). The Binding has DR equal to 1/3 your level (rounded down). Each point of damage reduces ST by one. At ST 0, the Binding is destroyed and the victim is freed.<br>
To simulate vines, webs, and so forth, add one or more of Area Effect (p. 102), Persistent (p. 107), and Wall (p. 109) - and possibly some of the special modifiers below.<br>
Egsample<br>
Bonds: In its simplest form, Binding ensnares the target with some kind of physical rope. This doesn't require special modifiers - but the two most common examples are webbing, which is Sticky (+20%), and the ability to cause existing vegetation to entangle the target, which is Environmental (-40%).<br>
Encasement: Individuals with the power to command elemental forces can sometimes materialize ice, stone, etc. around a foe, sealing him inside. Simulate this with Engulfing (+60%). Almost any attack can eventually chip away the material, so Only Damaged By X and Unbreakable are rarely appropriate.<br>
Entombment: Another common elemental attack is turning the earth beneath the victim's feet to mud or quicksand, causing him to sink into the ground. Wizards and evil priests might even command the ground to open up and swallow him! This is Engulfing (+60%), Unbreakable (+40%), and likely Suffocating (+75%). Since it only affects those who are touching the ground and not flying or standing on an artificial surface, it's also Environmental (-20%).<br>
Force Fields: Supers and wizards often restrain opponents with mysterious forces. Such Bindings are Unbreakable (+40%) and in most cases One-Shot (-10%). If the target is actually tied up - not just rooted in place - add Engulfing (+60%).<br>
Goo: Some monsters slime their prey with sticky goo. This glues the victim's arms to his sides, clogs his mouth, and leaves him helpless. Represent this with Engulfing (+60%), Only Damaged By Burning or Corrosion (+20%), and Sticky (+20%). Range is often limited; if so, add Reduced Range (-10%/level).<br>
These attacks bind a single foe. To affect more than one target by blanketing the area with webbing, quicksand, creeping vines, etc., add Area Effect (+50%/level). If the effect endures, and affects anyone who blunders into it, take Persistent (+40%), too. And if the persistent effect forms a vision-impeding barrier (like dense spider webs), stack Wall (+30% or +60%) on top of that.<br>
<hr>
</p><h3 class="card">Special Enhancements</h3><p class="card">
Engulfing: Your attack pins the target. He cannot move his limbs or speak; his only options are to use purely mental abilities, to attack the Binding with an Innate Attack, or to try to break free using ST (not Escape skill). If he tries to break free and fails, he is only allowed a repeated attempt every 10 seconds - and on a 17 or 18, he becomes so entangled that he cannot escape on his own! +60%.<br>
Only Damaged By X: Only specific damage types can damage your Binding. +30% for one of burning, corrosion, crushing, or cutting; +20% for any two; +10% for any three. Sticky: Your Binding is treated as Persistent (p. 107), but only affects those who actually touch the original target of your attack. +20%.<br>
Unbreakable: Your Binding cannot be destroyed. The only way to escape is to break free. +40%.<br>
Constricting: Your Binding actively constricts the victim. Until he breaks free, the Binding attacks him each turn with a Constriction Attack (p. B43), at a ST equal to that of the Binding. +75%.<br>
Suffocating: Your Binding cocoons the target or blocks his breathing passages. While it's in place, the victim cannot breathe. If he runs out of breath before he breaks free (see Holding Your Breath, p. B351), he starts to suffocate; see Suffocation (p. B436). +75%.<br>
<hr>
</p><h3 class="card">Special Limitations</h3><p class="card">
Environmental: Your Binding manipulates an existing condition or object in the environment, and won't work in its absence. This is worth from -20% (victim must be touching the ground) to -40% (victim must be standing in dense vegetation), at the GM's option.<br>
One-Shot: You cannot layer your Binding to increase its ST. -10%.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>BLESSED</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>10 or more points</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You are attuned to a god, demon lord, great spirit, cosmic power, etc. This can take various forms, but in all cases, you will lose this advantage if you fail to act in accordance with your deity's rules and values.<br>
Blessed: You sometimes receive wisdom from your deity. After communing with your god (meditating, praying, etc.) for at least one hour, you see visions or witness omens that have some bearing on future events. Work out the details with your GM; for instance, the God of Fire might require you to stare into flames for an hour, after which you hear a voice in the flames. The GM rolls secretly against your IQ to determine whether you gain any useful insight from this experience. The ritual is fatiguing, however; at the end of the hour, you lose 10 FP. As a side benefit, followers of your deity sense your special status and react to you at +1. 10 points.<br>
Very Blessed: As above, but your IQ roll to interpret visions is at +5 and the reaction bonus from your god's followers is +2. 20 points.<br>
Heroic Feats: Your blessing gives you the ability to perform a particular heroic feat. Once per game session, you may add 1d to one of ST, DX, or HT (other traits, such as Basic Move, are at the GM's discretion). You must specify which trait is boosted when you buy the advantage. This bonus lasts 3d seconds, after which your abilities revert to normal and you suffer any penalties amassed during the heroic period. (For instance, if your blessing boosts HP and you are reduced to -5 x your normal HP but not -5 x your blessed HP, you will die when the bonus HP wear off unless you receive some sort of healing.) 10 points.<br>
The GM may choose to allow other blessings as well.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>BRACHIATOR</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>5 points</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You can travel by swinging on vines, tree branches, ropes, chandeliers, etc. You get +2 to Climbing skill, and can move at half your Basic Move while brachiating.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>BREATH-HOLDING</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>2 points/level</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You are adept at holding your breath. Each level doubles the length of time you can do so (see Holding Your Breath, p. 351). Normal humans may not take this advantage - to be a world-record diver, learn Breath Control (p. 182). Nonhumans and supers can combine this advantage with Breath Control!</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>CATFALL</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>10 points</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You subtract five yards from a fall automatically (treat this as an automatic Acrobatics success - don't check again for it). In addition, a successful DX roll halves damage from any fall. To enjoy these benefits, your limbs must be unbound and your body free to twist as you fall.<br>
<hr>
</p><h3 class="card">Special Enhancements</h3><p class="card">
Feather Fall: You always enjoy the benefits of Catfall, even if bound and dropped on your head. +20%.<br>
<hr>
</p><h3 class="card">Special Limitations</h3><p class="card">
Parachute: You have a natural parachute, such as wings or skin flaps. This works like unmodified Catfall for falls that take two seconds or more, but deploys too slowly to affect shorter falls (distances of 6 x g yards or less). Your parachute needs open air in a radius equal to your height to function; it's worthless if falling down a narrow passage, and is of no use in very thin or thinner atmospheres. -30%.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>CHAMELEON</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>5 points/level</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You can change your surface pattern to blend into your surroundings. In any situation where being seen is a factor, you get +2 per level to Stealth skill when perfectly still, or +1 per level if moving. Clothing reduces this bonus to +1 per level when you are motionless, with no bonus if you are moving (unless the clothing is, in the GM's opinion, camouflaged relative to your current environment).<br>
Chameleon does not normally help in the dark or against someone relying upon senses other than sight. However, you can specify that your ability is effective against a particular visual or scanning sense (e.g., Infravision or Radar) instead of normal vision.<br>
<hr>
</p><h3 class="card">Special Enhancements</h3><p class="card">
Extended: Your ability affects more than one visual or scanning sense. Each sense beyond the first is +20%.<br>
Controllable: You can consciously select your surface pattern. The effects are mainly aesthetic, but there's a useful side benefit: you can assume a high-visibility pattern that gives +2 per level to your attempts to signal others and distract enemies, and to others' rolls to spot you. This is mutually exclusive with Always On. +20%.<br>
Dynamic: Your surface pattern adapts instantly to new surroundings and corrects for motion blur. You get your full Stealth bonus (+2 per level) when moving. +40%.<br>
<hr>
</p><h3 class="card">Special Limitations</h3><p class="card">
Always On: You cannot turn this ability off. Strangers react at -1; the flickering effect is irritating. -10%.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>CHANNELING</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>10 points</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You can become a conduit for the spirit world, allowing spirits to speak through you. To do so, you must enter a trance, achieved through one minute of concentration and a Will roll (at +2 if you have Autotrance, p. 101). You are unaware of the world around you while you are in this state.<br>
Once you have entered your trance, any spirit in the immediate vicinity can enter your body and use it to speak or write messages. The GM controls what the spirit does or says. The spirit answers questions put to it by others, but it is not bound to tell the truth.<br>
This is a minor form of possession: the spirit can use your body only to communicate. However, if it has the Possession ability (p. 75), it is considered to be touching you, and can attempt full possession while you are in a trance. You are considered wary, and thus get +5 to resist.<br>
<hr>
</p><h3 class="card">Special Enhancements</h3><p class="card">
Aware: You remain aware of the world when using your ability, and can move and act normally while spirits speak through you. +50%.<br>
<hr>
</p><h3 class="card">Special Limitations</h3><p class="card">
Specialized: You can only channel one specific class of spirits. Possibilities include angels, demons, elementals, faerie, ghosts, and anything else the GM wishes to allow. -50%.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>CHARISMA</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>5 points/level</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You have a natural ability to impress and lead others. Anyone can acquire a semblance of charisma through looks, manners, and intelligence - but real charisma is independent of these things. Each level gives +1 on all reaction rolls made by sapient beings with whom you actively interact (converse, lecture, etc.); +1 to Influence rolls (see Influence Rolls, p. 359); and +1 to Fortune-Telling, Leadership, Panhandling, and Public Speaking skills. The GM may rule that your Charisma does not affect members of extremely alien races.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>CLAIM TO HOSPITALITY</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>1 to 10 points</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You belong to a social group that encourages its members to assist one another. When you are away from home, you may call on other members of this group for food, shelter, and basic aid.<br>
The point cost depends on the extent and wealth of the group. A single friend with a house in another city is worth 1 point; a small family, 2 points; a society of merchants along an important trade route, 5 points; and a vast alliance of wealthy figures, such as every merchant in the world, 10 points. In the appropriate situation, members of the group should be easy to find (14 or less after 1d-1 hours of searching), but the chance of meeting one at random is small (6 or less to meet one in a small crowd in an appropriate place).<br>
Claim to Hospitality mainly saves the cost and trouble of finding lodging while on the road (although if you are wealthy, you might be expected to give gifts to your hosts), but there are side benefits. Members of the group are friendly to each other (+3 reactions), and may provide advice, introductions, and small loans, if asked. The level of assistance might occasionally approach that of Contacts (p. 44). If you expect anything more, though, buy Allies (p. 36) or Patrons (p. 72).<br>
This advantage cuts both ways. If you take it, you can be asked, when at home (at the GM's whim), to provide NPCs with exactly the same sort of hospitality you claim while away. This may become an adventure hook! If you refuse such aid, you will eventually get a bad name and lose this advantage.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>CLAIRSENTIENCE</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>50 points</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You can displace all of your ranged senses (for humans: sight, hearing, and smell) to a point outside your body. This viewpoint must be a specific location within 10 yards. You can modify this range with Increased Range (p. 106) or Reduced Range (p. 115). You can double your range temporarily by spending 2 FP per minute.<br>
To initiate Clairsentience, pick the desired viewpoint (which can be inside something) and its facing, concentrate for one minute, and then make an IQ roll. If the viewpoint is out of sight, you must specify distance and direction, and the roll is at -5.<br>
On a success, you can use your ranged senses as if you were physically present at the viewpoint (this means you cannot sense the environment around your body!). Your vision ignores darkness penalties completely. You cannot see through solid objects, but if your viewpoint were inside (for example) a closed chest, you would see what was inside despite the lack of light. If you are using or subjected to range-dependent abilities (e.g., spells), calculate all ranges from your body, not your viewpoint. You can maintain Clairsentience for as long as you like.<br>
On failure by 1, your senses go to some other viewpoint of the GM's choosing. On any greater failure, nothing happens at all. Critical failure cripples your ability for 1d hours.<br>
To return your displaced senses, move them elsewhere, or change their facing (usually only important for vision), you must concentrate for one second and make another IQ roll. However, a viewpoint inside a moving object (e.g., a car) will move with that object with no special concentration on your part. You can only have one viewpoint at a time - you cannot put hearing in one location, vision in another, etc.<br>
<hr>
</p><h3 class="card">Special Enhancements</h3><p class="card">
Aware: You can sense the environment around your body while using your ability. You can still only pay attention to one set of senses. At the start of each turn in combat, state whether you're giving priority to your natural senses or your remote ones. Concentrating to move or change the facing of your displaced senses automatically gives them priority, unless you also have Second Nature (below). All tasks that depend on the senses you aren't prioritizing - including attack rolls, defense rolls, and Sense rolls - are at -4. +50%.<br>
Projection: You don't merely send your senses out of body . . . you send out your consciousness. Your body falls unconscious unless you also have Aware. Your projected self is only vulnerable to spells, mental abilities, Maledictions, etc. See Projection (box) for other rules. +0% if you can only affect the insubstantial world (a new capability that balances leaving your body unconscious, not just insensible); +140% if you can use spells, mental abilities, and Maledictions on the material world from your viewpoint, too. If others can see your projection, take Visible (p. 112) as well.<br>
Second Nature: Your ability is reflexive. You can initiate it as a free action and change viewpoints as quickly as you can shift your gaze. You still need to concentrate for a minute and make an IQ-5 roll if your desired viewpoint is out of sight, with the usual bad effects on a failure. This enhancement is cheaper than Reduced Time, but only applies to Clairsentience. +70%.<br>
<hr>
</p><h3 class="card">Special Limitations</h3><p class="card">
Clairaudience: Only your sense of hearing is displaced. -30%.<br>
Clairosmia: Only your sense of smell is displaced. -60%.<br>
Clairvoyance: Only your sense of sight is displaced. -10%.<br>
ESP: Your ability is part of the ESP psi power (see p. 255). -10%.<br>
Visible: Your senses have a visible manifestation - for instance, a floating face. -10%.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>CLAWS</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>Variable</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You have claws. This advantage modifies all your hands and feet; there is no discount for claws on only some of your limbs. There are several variations:<br>
Blunt Claws: Very short claws, like those of a dog. Add +1 per die to the damage you inflict with a punch or kick; e.g., 2d-3 becomes 2d-1. 3 points.<br>
Hooves: Hard hooves, like those of a horse. Add +1 per die to the damage you inflict with a kick, and give your feet (only) +1 DR. 3 points.<br>
Sharp Claws: Short claws, like those of a cat. Change the damage you inflict with a punch or kick from crushing to cutting. 5 points.<br>
Talons: Longer claws - up to 12 long. Change the damage you inflict with a punch or kick from crushing to your choice of cutting or impaling (choose before you roll to hit). 8 points.<br>
Long Talons: Huge claws, like sword blades extending from your body! Treat these as Talons, but damage is +1 per die. 11 points.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>CLERICAL INVESTMENT</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>5 points</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You are an ordained priest of a recognized religion. You enjoy a number of privileges that a layman lacks, notably the authority to preside over weddings, funerals, and similar ceremonies. This gives you a +1 reaction bonus from co-religionists and those who respect your faith, and entitles you to use a title - Father, Sister, Rabbi, etc.<br>
Remember that not all clerics are good! Aka'Ar, high priest of the unholy Cult of Set, is also a vested priest. The blessings and marriages he performs are as meaningful to his followers as those of a vicar are to his parish. And - if Set so wills - Aka'Ar can perform exorcisms as potent as those of a Christian priest, if not more so. After all, Aka'Ar has a better working knowledge of demons . . .<br>
Clerical Investment is purely social in nature. It does not confer miraculous powers. If you wish to wield divine power by proxy, take Blessed (p. 40), Power Investiture (p. 77), or True Faith (p. 94).<br>
Clerical Investment includes Religious Rank 0 (see p. 30). If you want more influence within your church, buy up your Rank.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>CLINGING</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>20 points</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You can walk or crawl on walls and ceilings. You can stop at any point and stick to the surface without fear of falling. Neither feat requires a roll against Climbing skill, provided the surface is one you can cling to. Move while clinging is half your Basic Move.<br>
If you are falling and try to grab a vertical surface to break your fall, the GM must first decide whether there is anything in reach. If there is, make a DX roll to touch the surface, and then make a ST roll at -1 per 5 yards already fallen. If you succeed, you stop your fall. Otherwise, you continue to fall - but you may subtract 5 yards from the height of the fall thanks to the slowing effect of the failed Clinging attempt. Variations in gravity affect these distances; e.g., in 0.5G, the ST roll would be at -1 per 10 yards.<br>
<hr>
</p><h3 class="card">Special Enhancements</h3><p class="card">
Attraction: You can cling to a surface with any part of your body - you don't need to assume a crawling posture. You can walk upright along a vertical surface, leaving your arms free, or even hang from the top of your head or your back in order to use all of your limbs. +25%.

Requires Low Gravity: Your ability doesn't function in gravity fields over a certain, maximum strength. For humans, this is typically 0.6G. -5% per 0.1G under 1G (-5% for 0.9G, -10% for 0.8G, and so on - down to -50% for 0G).</p,></div></div>

You never freeze in a surprise situation, and get +6 on all IQ rolls to  wake up, or to recover from surprise or mental stun. Your side gets +1 on initiative rolls to avoid a surprise attack - +2 if you are the leader. For details, see Surprise Attacks and Initiative (p. 393).<br>

Your compartments are identical, but hypnotism, magic, psionics, and the like affect them separately (e.g., one compartment could be hypnotized without affecting any of the others).<br>
This advantage does not allow your body to perform more than one task. A normal character may select one maneuver on his turn in combat. This of Compartmentalized Mind adds one extra mental maneuver to this allotment. For instance, Compartmentalized Mind 1 would let you perform one mental maneuver and one physical maneuver (e.g., Concentrate on a spell and Attack) or two mental maneuvers (e.g., Concentrate on two spells), but never more than one physical maneuver - for that, see Extra Attack (p. 53).<br>
If one compartment is under external influence, roll a Quick Contest of Will to see whether it gains control of the body. The compartment currently in control of the body rolls at +1. Battling compartments may attempt to use mental powers on each other. Treat them as completely separate minds for this purpose, each with your IQ, Will, and mental abilities (such as Mind Shield). Two variations on this advantage are available for vehicles built as characters: Controls: Each level buys one set of controls.<br>
Controls let an operator perform his own physical or mental maneuvers using your abilities (e.g., Innate Attack or Radar), as per the rules for vehicular combat (see p. 467). The operator directs all actions of an IQ 0 vehicle with this advantage. Physical limits still apply; for instance, a vehicle can make no more attacks than it has ready weapons. Resolve conflicts between operators by rolling a Quick Contest of vehicle operation skill. 25 points/level.<br>
Dedicated Controls: As Controls, but each set of controls handles a specific task; e.g., tail gunner. The person manning them can't operate anything else. 10 points/level.</p,></div></div>

<div><h2 class='points'>15 points</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>Your musculature is optimized for crushing your opponents - whether by hugging like a bear or constricting like a python. To use this ability, you must first successfully grapple your intended victim, whose Size Modifier (p. 19) cannot exceed your own. On your next turn, and each successive turn, roll a Quick Contest: your ST vs. your victim's ST or HT, whichever is higher. If you win, your victim takes damage equal to your margin of victory; otherwise, he takes no damage.<br>
Engulfing: You totally engulf your victim. If he doesn't break free between when you grapple him and when you start to crush him, he's pinned; see Pin (p. B370). This pin is completely hands free. Victims with abilities such as Innate Attack and Spines can hit you automatically while engulfed, however. If so, you get no active defense. +60%.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>CONTACT GROUP</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>Variable</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You have a network of Contacts (see Contacts, below) placed throughout a particular organization or social stratum. You must specify a corporation, criminal syndicate, military unit, police department, or similar organization, or the underworld, merchants, upper class, etc. of one particular town. Broader Contact Groups are not allowed.<br>
You may request information from a Contact Group exactly as you would an individual Contact, using the same rules for frequency of appearance, effective skill, and reliability. The difference is that a Contact Group's effective skill reflects ability at an entire category of skills - e.g., business skills if your Contact Group is a corporation, or military skills if your Contact Group is a military unit - as opposed to one specific skill. You must define this area of knowledge when you purchase the Contact Group, and it must be appropriate to the organization.<br>
The GM rolls against the group's effective skill when you request any information that it could reasonably provide. However, this is an abstract success roll, not a roll against a specific skill. For instance, a police Contact Group could provide ballistics comparisons, criminal profiles, legal advice, police records, and introductions to criminals. It would not specifically use Forensics, Criminology, Law, Administration, or Streetwise skills for this, but the information provided might be appropriate to any of these police skills.<br>
To determine the point cost of a Contact Group, select its effective skill, frequency of appearance, and reliability level just as you would for a simple Contact, then multiply the resulting cost by 5.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>CONTACTS</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>Variable</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You have an associate who provides you with useful information, or who does small (pick any two of quick, nonhazardous, and inexpensive) favors for you. The point value of a Contact is based on the skill he uses to assist you, the frequency with which he provides information or favors, and his reliability as a person.<br>
<hr>
Effective Skill of Contact<br>
First, decide on the type of Contact you have. He might be anything from a wino in the right gutter to a head of state, depending on your background. What is important is that he has access to information, knows you, and is likely to react favorably. (Of course, offering cash or favors is never a bad idea; the GM will set the Contact's price.)<br>
Next, choose the useful skill your Contact provides. This skill must match the Contact's background; e.g., Finance for a banker or Forensics for a lab technician. Since the GM rolls against this skill when you request aid from your Contact, you should select a skill that can provide the results you expect. If you want ballistics comparisons, take a Contact with Forensics, not Finance! <br>
After that, select an effective skill level. This reflects the Contact's connections, other skills, Status, etc. It need not be his actual skill level (the GM will set this, if it matters). For instance, the president of a local steel mill might have business-related skills of 12-14, but his effective skill might be 18 because of his position in the company. This skill level determines the Contact's base cost:<br>
{style=width:300px; background-color: #e8ffe7; margin: auto; border-collapse:collapse; text-align:center;<br>
!Effective SkillBase Cost<br>
 style=background-color: #ffffff;<br>
121 point<br>
152 point<br>
 style=background-color: #ffffff;<br>
183 point<br>
214 point<br>
Add 1 point to these costs for Contacts who can obtain information using supernatural talents (ESP, magical divination, etc.). This is common for spirits, wizards, etc.<br>
<hr>
Frequency of Appearance<br>
Select a frequency of appearance, as explained under Frequency of Appearance (p. 36), and apply its multiplier to the base cost of the Contact. When you wish to reach your Contact, the GM rolls against his frequency of appearance. On a failure, the Contact is busy or cannot be located that day. On a 17 or 18, the Contact cannot be reached for the entire adventure! On a success, the GM will roll against the Contact's effective skill once per piece of information or minor favor you request.<br>
No Contact may be reached more than once per day, even if several PCs share the same Contact. If you have several questions to ask, you should have them all in mind when you first reach your Contact. The Contact answers the first question at his full effective skill. Each subsequent question is at a cumulative -2. Don't overuse your Contacts! <br>
A Contact can never supply information outside his area of knowledge. Use common sense. Likewise, the GM must not allow a Contact to give information that short-circuits an important part of the adventure.<br>
You must explain how you normally get in touch with your Contact. Regardless of frequency of appearance, you cannot reach your Contact if those channels are closed.<br>
<hr>
Reliability<br>
Contacts are not guaranteed to be truthful. Reliability multiplies the Contact's point cost as follows:<br>
Completely Reliable: Even on a critical failure on his effective skill roll, the Contact's worst response will be I don't know. On an ordinary failure, he can find information in 1d days. x3.<br>
Usually Reliable: On a critical failure, the Contact lies. On any other failure, he doesn't know now, . . . but check back in (1d) days. Roll again at that time; a failure then means he can't find out at all. x2.<br>
Somewhat Reliable: On a failure, the Contact doesn't know and can't find out. On a critical failure, he lies - and on a natural 18, he lets the opposition or authorities (as appropriate) know who is asking questions. x1.<br>
Unreliable: Reduce effective skill by 2. On any failure, he lies; on a critical failure, he notifies the enemy. x1/2 (round up; minimum final cost is 1 point).<br>
<hr>
Money Talks<br>
Bribery, whether cash or favors, motivates a Contact and increases his reliability level. Once reliability reaches usually reliable, further levels of increase go to effective skill; bribery cannot make anyone completely reliable!<br>
A cash bribe should be about equivalent to one day's income for a +1 bonus, one week's income for +2, one month's for +3, and one year's for +4. Favors should be of equivalent worth, and should always be something that you actually play out in the game.<br>
The bribe must also be appropriate to the Contact. A diplomat would be insulted by a cash bribe, but might welcome an introduction into the right social circle. A criminal might ask for cash but settle for favors that could get you in trouble. A police detective or wealthy executive might simply want you to owe him one for later . . . which could set off a whole new adventure, somewhere down the road.<br>
<hr>
Contacts in Play<br>
You may add new Contacts in play, provided you can come up with a good in-game justification. The GM might even turn an existing NPC into a Contact for one or more PCs - possibly in lieu of character points for the adventure in which the PCs developed the NPC as a Contact. For instance, the reward for an adventure in which the party helped solve a bank robbery might be a knowledgeable, reliable police Contact.<br>
<hr>
Examples of Contacts<br>
The list of all possible Contacts - and their skills - would fill an entire book. Here are just a few examples:<br>
Business. Business owners, executives, secretaries, and even the mailroom flunky can supply information on business dealings. They generally provide a business skill, such as Accounting, Administration, or Finance. A mail boy or typist might have effective skill 12; the president's secretary has skill 15; a senior executive or accountant has skill 18; and the CEO, president, or chairman of the board has skill 21.<br>
Military. This could be anyone from an enlisted grunt to a general. Such Contacts might provide information on troop movements, details on secret weapons or tactics, or top-level strategy. This could take the form of Savoir- Faire (Military), Strategy, or Tactics skill - or perhaps a technical skill, such as Engineer. A Rank 0 soldier would have effective skill 12, a Rank 1- 2 NCO would have skill 15, a Rank 3- 5 officer would have skill 18, and a Rank 6 or higher officer would have skill 21.<br>
Police. Anyone connected with law enforcement and criminal investigations: beat cops, corporate security, government agents, forensics specialists, coroners, etc. Typical skills are Criminology, Forensics, Intelligence Analysis, and Law. Beat cops and regular private security officers have effective skill 12; detectives, federal agents, and records clerks are skill 15; administrators (lieutenants, captains, Special Agents in Charge, etc.) are skill 18; and senior officers (sheriffs, chiefs of police, District Superintendents, Security Chiefs, etc.) are skill 21.<br>
Street. Thugs, fences, gang members, mobsters, and the like can provide information on illicit activities, local criminal gossip, upcoming crimes, etc. Most provide Streetwise skill. Unconnected crooks (those who are not part of the local criminal organization) have effective skill 12; connected ones are skill 15; mob lieutenants and other powerful criminals are skill 18; and an actual crime lord (e.g., the Don, clan chief, or Master of the Thieves' Guild) has skill 21.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>CULTURAL ADAPTABILITY</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>10 or 20 points</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You are familiar with a broad spectrum of cultures. When dealing with those cultures, you never suffer the -3 cultural unfamiliarity penalty given under Culture (p. 23). This is definitely a cinematic ability! Point cost depends on the scope of your familiarity:<br>
Cultural Adaptability: You are familiar with all cultures of your race. 10 points.<br>
Xeno-Adaptability: You are familiar with all cultures in your game world, regardless of race. 20 points.</p,></div></div>

<div><p class='card'>You are familiar with cultures other than your own, and do not suffer the -3 penalty for unfamiliarity. This costs 1 point per culture of the same (or very similar) race, or 2 points per alien culture.<br>
To prevent point-cost inflation, the GM should use broad definitions of culture: East Asian, Muslim, Western, etc. A single nation would have to be very different to merit its own Cultural Familiarity. In fantasy worlds, the GM might wish to have one culture per race; in a futuristic setting, an entire planet or even a galactic empire might have a single, monolithic culture.<br>

<div><p class='card'>Treat most cybernetic implants as equivalent advantages: Infravision for a bionic eye, Damage Resistance for dermal armor, etc. Some implants may qualify for the Temporary Disadvantage limitation (p. 115); suitable temporary disadvantages include Electrical (p. 134) and Maintenance (p. 143). These apply to the implant, not to your overall capabilities.<br>

<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>DAMAGE RESISTANCE </h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>5 points/level</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>Your body itself has a Damage Resistance score. Subtract this from the damage done by any physical or energy attack after the DR of artificial armor (you can normally wear armor over natural DR) but before multiplying the injury for damage type. By default, natural DR does not protect your eyes (or windows, if you are a vehicle) or help against purely mental attacks, such as telepathy.<br>
Normal humans cannot purchase DR at all. Creatures with natural armor can buy DR 1 to 5. Thick skin or a pelt would be DR 1; pig hide, armadillo shell, a heavy pelt, or scales like those of a lizard would be DR 2; rhinoceros hide or a pangolin's armor plates would be DR 3; alligator scales or elephant hide would be DR 4; and a giant tortoise would have DR 5. Robots, supers, supernatural entities, etc. can purchase any amount of DR, subject to GM approval.<br>
Many special modifiers are available to change the basic assumptions of this advantage.<br>
Egsample<br>
Active Control: Those with powers - especially elemental ones - can frequently use their gifts to divert or negate incoming energies. Such DR is typically Limited. An entire power source is Very Common (-20%), while a specific focus is Common (-40%). Many such defenses intercept attacks at a distance from the body, justifying Force Field (+20%). Supers often add Absorption (+80% or +100%) or Reflection (+100%), too. In the case of Absorption, use Extended Duration (+20%/level) to slow the rate at which absorbed points trickle away.<br>
Damage Tolerance: Some creatures are huge, have redundant organs (or lack organs), or have a reinforced structure that lets them absorb a lot of punishment. To represent this, use Ablative (-80%). This effectively turns DR into Hit Points that don't result in shock, stunning, knockdown, etc. when lost, but that don't increase the damage needed to cause crippling or death.<br>
Force Field: A close-fitting sheath of energy or matter projected around the body is a common supernatural and superscience defense, and calls for Force Field (+20%). Add Can't Wear Armor (-40%) if this repels anything that gets close to the body, and Temporary Disadvantage, No Fine Manipulators (-30%) if it prevents picking things up. A field that only screens against frontal attacks, like a shield, has Directional (-20%). Add Affects Others (+50%) and Area Effect (+50%/level) for a field that covers an area.<br>
Natural Armor: Many natural creatures have a hardened, padded, or thickened outer layer that reduces the impact of attacks. Bone or chitin calls for unmodified DR, a thick fat layer requires Flexible (-20%), and leathery skin has Tough Skin (-40%). If this results in a pointy, irregularly shaped, or bulky body that makes clothing impossible, add Can't Wear Armor (-40%).<br>
<hr>
</p><h3 class="card">Special Enhancements</h3><p class="card">
Absorption: You can absorb damage and use it to enhance your abilities. Each point of DR stops one point of damage and turns it into one character point that you can use to improve traits (anything but skills) temporarily. You store these points in a battery with capacity equal to DR (e.g., DR 10 gives a 10-point battery). Once this battery is full, each point of DR will still stop one point of damage, but will not convert it into a character point. You do not have to use stored points immediately, but you cannot reallocate points once used. You lose absorbed points - unused ones first - at the rate of one point per second. You lose enhanced abilities as the points drain away. (Exception: If you are missing HP or FP, you can heal yourself. Restoring one HP drains 2 stored points immediately; restoring one FP drains 3 points. Such healing is permanent. Only HP or FP in excess of your usual scores drain away.) You cannot absorb damage from your own ST or attack abilities. +80% if absorbed points can only enhance one trait (determined when you create your character) or can only heal; +100% if you can raise any trait.<br>
Force Field: Your DR takes the form of a field projected a short distance from your body. This protects your entire body - including your eyes - as well as anything you are carrying, and reduces the damage from attacks before armor DR. Effects that rely on touch (such as many magic spells) only affect you if carried by an attack that does enough damage to pierce your DR. +20%.<br>
Hardened: Each level of Hardened reduces the armor divisor of an attack by one step. These steps are, in order: ignores DR, 100, 10, 5, 3, 2, and 1 (no divisor). +20% per level.<br>
Reflection: Your DR bounces back any damage it stops at your attacker. The remaining damage affects you normally. The attacker doesn't get an active defense against the first attack you reflect back at him, but gets his usual defenses against subsequent reflected attacks. Reflection only works vs. direct hits! It cannot reflect damage from explosions, fragments, poison gas, or anything else that affects an entire area. This enhancement is mutually exclusive with Absorption. +100%.<br>
<hr>
</p><h3 class="card">Special Limitations</h3><p class="card">
Ablative: Your DR stops damage once. Each point of DR stops one point of basic damage but is destroyed in the process. Lost DR heals at the same rate as lost HP (including the effects of Regeneration, p. 80). Use this to represent supers who can absorb massive punishment but who lack the mass to justify a large HP score. -80%.<br>
Can't Wear Armor: Your body is designed in such a way that you cannot or will not wear body armor or clothing. -40%.<br>
Directional: Your DR only protects against attacks from one direction. -20% for the front (F); -40% for the back (B), right (R), left (L), top (T), or underside (U). Humanoids may only take this limitation for front and back.<br>
Flexible: Your DR is not rigid. This leaves you vulnerable to blunt trauma (see p. 379). -20%.<br>
Limited: Your DR applies only to certain attack forms or damage types. See Limited Defenses (box) for details. Partial: Your DR only protects a specific hit location. This is worth -10% per -1 penalty to hit that body part (see p. 398). For instance, an animal with butting horns and a thick skull might have Skull only, for -70%. Torso only is -10%, and also protects the vital organs. When you take this limitation for arms, legs, hands, or feet, the DR protects all limbs of that type. If it only protects one limb, the limitation value doubles (e.g., arms are -2 to hit, so a single arm would be -40%). If you have arms, legs, etc. with different penalties, use the least severe penalty to calculate limitation value. Semi-Ablative: When an attack strikes semi-ablative DR, every 10 points of basic damage rolled removes one point of DR, regardless of whether the attack penetrates DR. Lost DR heals as for Ablative (and you cannot combine the two). -20%.<br>
Tough Skin: By default, Damage Resistance is hard: armor plate, chitin, etc. With this limitation, your DR is merely tough skin. Any effect that requires a scratch (e.g., poison) or skin contact (e.g., electrical shock or Pressure Points skill) affects you if the attack carrying it penetrates the DR of any armor you are wearing - even if it does exactly 0 damage! Your natural DR, being living tissue, provides no protection at all against such attacks. This limitation includes all the effects of the Flexible limitation (see above); you cannot take both. It is mutually incompatible with Force Field. -40%. Layered Defenses You may have multiple layers of DR with different combinations of modifiers. You must specify the order of the layers - from outermost to innermost - when you create your character. You may not change this order once set.<br>

On a success, you get enough of a warning that you can take action. A roll of 3 or 4 means you get a little detail as to the nature of the danger.<br>

Color Vision: You can see colors in the dark. +20%.<br>
Hypersensory: Your brain builds up a picture of your surroundings from the input of your senses of hearing, smell, and touch (temperature differences, vibrations, and even electric fields), and from tiny flashes of light due to chemical reactions, static discharges, and cosmic ray impacts. You're not aware of these things individually, but collectively, they let you see in the dark as if it were daylight, and even spot invisible foes. Each sense you lose - hearing, smell, touch, or vision - gives -2 to Vision rolls (this penalty can't exceed the current darkness penalty). You're only truly blind if you lose all four. You're still limited to the standard human arc of vision unless you have Peripheral Vision or 360° Vision. +40%.</p,></div></div>

<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>DESTINY</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>Variable</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>Your fate is preordained. This is considered an advantage if you are destined for great things - although this might not always be clear, and might even be inconvenient at times. For a disadvantageous Destiny, see p. 131.<br>
When you choose this advantage, you may only specify its point value. The GM will secretly determine the nature of your Destiny, according to its point value and the dictates of the campaign. You might discover some clues about your Destiny via magical divination or similar techniques, but you are highly unlikely to learn its full extent until it is fulfilled. Note also that a Destiny may change as the campaign develops.<br>
Be aware that this advantage gives the GM absolute license to meddle with your life - the GM must make the Destiny work out! Working out a good Destiny and making sure it comes to pass require considerable ingenuity on the part of the GM. The GM may wish to forbid this advantage if he feels it would send the campaign off the rails.<br>
The point value of the Destiny determines its impact:<br>
Great Advantage: You are fated to achieve greatness within your lifetime. In the end, everyone will know and praise your name! Sooner or later, something will happen to bring this Destiny to fruition. Note that this does not guarantee success. If you choose to jump in front of an assassin's knife during your first game session, the GM might just decide the Destiny is fulfilled . . . you died a hero! 15 points.<br>
Major Advantage: As above, but to a lesser extent. Alternatively, you might be doomed to die in a particular place or in a particular fashion: at sea, by the hand of an emperor, underground, or whatever. You can be grievously wounded - even maimed - under other circumstances, but you will not die. If you avoid the circumstances that would fulfill your Destiny, knowingly or otherwise, you might find that Fate has a few surprises. The sea might flood your home while you sleep, the general against whom you march might be the future emperor, or Mt. Vesuvius might bury you under tons of ash. 10 points.<br>
Minor Advantage: You are fated to play a small part in a larger story, but this part will reflect to your credit. In game terms, you are guaranteed one significant victory. 5 points.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>DETECT</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>Variable</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You can detect a specific substance or condition, even when it is shielded from the five human senses. This requires one second of concentration, after which the GM will secretly make a Sense roll for you (see Sense Rolls, p. 358). The range modifiers from the Size and Speed/Range Table (p. 550) apply. You may buy a special Acute Sense (p. 35) to improve the roll, thereby increasing your effective range.<br>
On a success, the GM tells you the direction to the nearest significant source of the substance, and give you a clue as to the quantity present. On a failure, you sense nothing.<br>
Detect also includes the ability to analyze what you detect. This requires an IQ roll; the better the roll, the more precise the details. For instance, if you had Detect (Metal), you could tell gold from iron on a successful IQ roll, and might learn details - such as whether the gold is in the form of ore or bars, and its precise purity - on a critical success.<br>
The base cost of Detect is as follows:<br>
Rare (sorceresses, fire magic, zombies, gold, radar, radio): 5 points.<br>
Occasional (spellcasters, magic, undead, precious metal, electric fields, magnetic fields, radar and radio): 10 points.<br>
Common (humans, supernatural phenomena, supernatural beings, metal, electric and magnetic fields): 20 points.<br>
Very Common (all life, all supernatural phenomena and beings, all minerals, all energy): 30 points.<br>
Note that the ability to detect certain phenomena can often justify other advantages. For instance, Detect (Magnetic Fields) could explain Absolute Direction.<br>
Egsample<br>
Extended Senses: Detect can emulate almost any kind of believable remote sensing. Senses like Detect (Magnetic Fields) and Detect (Radio) suit realistic robots and vehicles as well as supers. Signal Detection (+0%) is common for such abilities.<br>
Para-Senses: Detect might instead sense ordinary things that would realistically defy discovery without physically searching the area or taking a sample; e.g., Detect (Cats), Detect (Disease), Detect (Gold), or Detect (Poison). Such abilities might be superscience or a form of supernatural divination.<br>
Supernatural Awareness: Detect could be a supernatural sensitivity to otherworldly forces; e.g., Detect (Magic). It might even sense moral concepts. What this means is up to the GM - a zombie or serial killer might trigger Detect (Evil) in some worlds but not others. Moral powers always set it off, however.<br>

Signal Detection: You can detect an active transmission of some sort, such as a radio, radar, or laser; see Scanning Sense (p. 81) and Telecommunication (p. 91). You suffer no range penalties, but must be within twice the signal's own range and (if the signal is directional) within in its path. +0%.<br>
Analyzing: Your sense has an extremely high resolution, like a superscience scanner. Basic analysis is automatic if your Sense roll succeeds. Only make a separate IQ roll if you opt to do a detailed analysis. Success reveals details such as the form and purity of the item sensed, its precise subclass, etc. This is incompatible with Vague. +100%.<br>

Vague: You can only detect the presence or absence of the target substance. Direction and quantity are revealed only on a critical success, and you cannot analyze what you detect. This limitation is mutually exclusive with Precise. -50%.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>DIGITAL MIND</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>5 points</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You are a sentient computer program - possibly an artificial intelligence or an upload of a living mind. By default, you inhabit a body that includes a computer with Complexity equal to at least half your IQ; see Computers (p. 472).<br>
You are completely immune to any power defined as Telepathic, and to magic spells that specifically affect living minds. However, computer viruses and abilities that affect Digital Minds can affect you; you can be taken offline (or even stored, unconscious, as data); and those with Computer Hacking or Computer Programming skill can gain access to your data . . . and possibly read or alter your consciousness!<br>
You are likely to have the Machine meta-trait (p. 263), but this is not mandatory, as you could be a computer- like mind inside an organic body (e.g., a bio-computer or a brain implant). The Reprogrammable disadvantage (p. 150) is also common for Digital Minds, as is the Automaton meta-trait (p. 263), but you do not have to possess either trait. Many advantages are also possible but not automatic:<br>
Computing Power: If you operate faster than a human mind, buy Enhanced Time Sense (p. 52). If you can add advantages or skills temporarily by running programs, buy Modular Abilities (p. 71).<br>
Copies: If you can run multiple copies of your mind on a single computer system, buy Compartmentalized Mind (p. 43). If you can create loyal copies that run on other systems, buy Duplication (p. 50) with the Digital limitation. If you have copies backed up offline, buy Extra Life (p. 55).<br>
Uploading: If you can actively upload yourself into other computers, buy Possession (p. 75) with the Digital limitation. If you can do this easily, buy extra bodies as Puppets (p. 78).</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>DISCRIMINATORY HEARING</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>15 points</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You have a superhuman ability to distinguish between sounds. You can always identify people by voice, and can recognize individual machines by their sound signature. You may memorize a sound by listening to it for at least one minute and making a successful IQ roll. On a failure, you must wait at least one full day before making a repeated attempt.<br>
You get +4 (in addition to any Acute Hearing bonuses) on any task that utilizes hearing, and receive +4 to Shadowing skill when following a noisy target.<br>
To simulate the passive sonar used by submarines, add a -30% Accessibility limitation, Only underwater.<br>
Profiling: You possess an extensive mental database of sensory signatures that you can quickly compare to new sensory impressions. This doubles the bonus to analyze and recognize targets (but not to sense or track them) to +8. As a side benefit, all attempts to memorize new signatures succeed automatically - there's no need for an IQ roll. +50%.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>DISCRIMINATORY SMELL</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>15 points</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>Your sense of smell is far beyond the human norm, and can register distinctive odors for practically everything you may encounter. This allows you to recognize people, places, and things by scent. You may memorize a scent by sniffing it for at least one minute and making a successful IQ roll. On a failure, you must wait at least one full day before making a repeated attempt.<br>
You get +4 (in addition to any Acute Taste and Smell bonuses) on any task that utilizes the sense of smell, and receive +4 to Tracking skill.<br>
If you actually become ill when exposed to the odor of a particular substance, take the Temporary Disadvantage limitation (p. 115). The most common effect is Revulsion (p. 151), but the GM may choose to allow other temporary disadvantages.<br>
<hr>

<div><h2 class='points'>10 points</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>This talent functions in most ways like Discriminatory Smell (above), but enhances the sense of taste instead, so tracking is not possible. You must ingest a small quantity of the material to be examined; for a living subject, this means bodily fluids. This gives you an IQ roll to recognize the taste, identify whether a substance is safe to eat, etc. You can perform a detailed analysis with a roll against a suitable skill (Chemistry, Cooking, Pharmacy, Poisons . . .). You get +4 (in addition to any Acute Taste and Smell bonuses) on any task that utilizes the sense of taste.<br>
Profiling: You possess an extensive mental database of sensory signatures that you can quickly compare to new sensory impressions.

<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>DOESNT BREATHE</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>20 points</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You do not breathe or require oxygen. Choking and strangulation attempts cannot harm (or silence!) you, and you are immune to inhaled toxins. You are still affected by contact poisons, pressure, and vacuum; take Sealed (p. 82), Pressure Support (p. 77), and Vacuum Support (p. 96), respectively, to resist those threats.<br>
<hr>
</p><h3 class="card">Special Limitations</h3><p class="card">
Gills: You can extract oxygen from water, allowing you to remain submerged indefinitely. You suffocate if the water contains no dissolved oxygen. You are immune to strangulation and the bends. If you can only survive underwater, and suffocate in air as quickly as a normal human would drown underwater, Doesn't Breathe (Gills) is a 0-point feature; otherwise, -50%.<br>
Oxygen Absorption: As Gills, but you can absorb oxygen through the surface of your body whether it is in the air, a liquid, or another medium. Your body does not absorb poisonous gases, but you will suffocate if there is no oxygen available. You can use breathing equipment in space (your lungs are capable of working normally). You may not have the Sealed advantage. -25%.<br>
Oxygen Combustion: As Oxygen Absorption, but you cannot breathe underwater or anywhere else fire cannot burn. -50%.<br>
Oxygen Storage: You need to breathe, but you can go for extended periods of time without doing so; perhaps you store oxygen (like a whale) or have superior blood oxygenation. This differs from Breath-Holding in that you are completely immune to the bends while your oxygen supply holds out. If you can effectively hold your breath for 25 times as long as usual, this is -50%; 50 times, -40%; 100 times, -30%; 200 times, -20%; 300 times, -10%.</p,></div></div>

<div><p class='card'>You do not have to sleep at all. You can ignore all ill effects from missed nights of rest.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>DOMINANCE</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>20 points</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You can infect others with a supernatural condition - vampirism, lycanthropy, etc. - and exert absolute control over them. This trait is only appropriate for supernatural beings that spread their curse through infection, and only affects members of susceptible races (typically your original race and very similar races). The GM is the judge of which curses are spread this way and who is susceptible.<br>
When you buy Dominance, you must specify one natural attack - Claws, Innate Attack, Vampiric Bite, etc. - that delivers the infection. Anyone you damage this way must roll 3d vs. the HP of injury he received (maximum one roll per day). If he rolls under the damage amount, he becomes infected, and will change into the same kind of creature as you in 2d days, or at the GM's discretion, without suitable supernatural intervention. The GM is free to impose additional conditions for infection; for instance, the victim might have to suffer three attacks, or share your blood, or even die before making the roll above.<br>
Once the transition is complete, the victim acquires your supernatural racial template (Vampire, Werewolf, etc.) plus Slave Mentality (p. 154). He becomes your subordinate. If he goes on to infect others, his victims will acquire the same traits and serve you as well.<br>
Dominance itself costs 20 points, but to control a new victim, you must have sufficient unspent points to buy him as an Ally (p. 36) with the enhancements Minion (due to his Slave Mentality) and Special Abilities (because he can create new servitors for you). You can choose any frequency of appearance, and may improve this later on with earned points. If you lack the points to buy you victim as an Ally - even at a frequency of 6 or less - he will still be infected but he will not become your slave.<br>
Dominance persists until you die (truly die, for undead), or your slave grows in power and you cannot (or choose not to) spend the points to keep him as an Ally, or the GM rules the curse is broken via supernatural means. If any of these things occur, your victim will lose Slave Mentality and become free-willed. You may use the points spent on your former Ally to dominate new victims.<br>
See Infectious Attack (p. 140) for the disadvantageous form of Dominance.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>DUPLICATION</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>35 points/copy</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You can split into two or more bodies (Dupes), each possessing your full knowledge and powers (but not copies of your equipment, unless you buy a special enhancement). It takes one second and a Concentrate maneuver to separate or merge. When your Dupes merge, your FP and HP are the average of all your copies' FP and HP at that time. Your combined self remembers everything experienced by any Dupe.<br>
Dupes have no special ability to coordinate with one another. For that, buy Telesend (see Telecommunication, p. 91). If your Telesend works only with your Dupes, you may take the Racial limitation. You may combine Telesend with a Mindlink (p. 70) with your Dupes, in which case you are in constant telepathic contact - no die rolls required.<br>
If one of your Dupes dies, all the others immediately take 2d damage and are stunned. This is mental stun if you define Duplication as a mental trait, physical stun if you define it as a physical trait. The IQ or HT roll to recover is at -6. You also lose the points you spent for that Dupe. The GM may allow you to buy back a dead Dupe with unspent points. Alternatively, an Extra Life (p. 55) will let you bring back any one dead Dupe. Your point value drops by the price of the Extra Life, but this is cheaper than buying back a Dupe.<br>
<hr>
</p><h3 class="card">Special Enhancements</h3><p class="card">
Duplicated Gear: Your Dupes appear with copies of Signature Gear (p. 85) that you are carrying or wearing. Duplicated equipment vanishes when you merge, even if it becomes separated from you. Treat your equipment's HP, ammunition, energy supply, etc. just like your own HP and FP when you merge. +100%.<br>
No Sympathetic Injury: If one of your Dupes is killed, the others are not stunned or hurt. +20%.<br>
Construct: Your Dupes are material projections under your mental control. When you dispel them, they vanish, leaving you with your current - not average - FP and HP. You also enjoy all the benefits of No Sympathetic Injury (don't buy it separately). Finally, the death of a Dupe isn't permanent: by taking a Concentrate maneuver and spending 10 FP, you can generate a replacement. But there's only one true you, and if you die, all your Dupes die with you! This is incompatible with Digital and Shared Resources. +60%.<br>
<hr>
</p><h3 class="card">Special Limitations</h3><p class="card">
Digital: Your Dupes are software copies of your mind, not physical copies of your body. They can possess other computers or occupy spare Puppets (p. 78). You may only take this limitation if you have both Digital Mind (p. 48) and Possession (Digital) (p. 75). -60%.<br>
Shared Resources: Your Dupes do not share your full FP and HP; instead, you must distribute your FP and HP among them. For instance, if you had 15 HP and one Dupe, you could split your HP 7 and 8, 2 and 13, or in any other combination that totaled 15. You need not distribute FP and HP proportionally; with 15 HP and 15 FP, you could give one copy 3 FP and 9 HP and the other 12 FP and 6 HP. When your bodies re-combine, add their FP and HP instead of averaging. -40%.<br>
Sequential: You and your Dupes are chained together in a specific order. Number them from 1 (the original you) on up. When a Dupe dies, all higher-numbered Dupes vanish, too. This lets you create a character who can summon copies of himself from one possible future, with later copies dependent on the survival of earlier ones. Add Construct (above) if you can replace dead Dupes with copies from other possible futures. -40%.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>EIDETIC MEMORY</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>5 or 10 points</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You have an exceptionally good memory. Anyone may attempt an IQ roll to recall the general sense of past events - the better the roll, the truer the memory, but the details are sketchy. With this talent, you automatically succeed at these memory rolls, and you often recall precise details. <br>
This trait affects recall, not comprehension, and so does not benefit skills. However, it gives a bonus whenever the GM requires an IQ roll for learning: +5 for Eidetic Memory, +10 for Photographic Memory.<br>
This trait comes in two levels:<br>
Eidetic Memory: You automatically remember the general sense of everything you concentrate on, and can recall specific details by making an IQ roll. It is possible to learn this advantage in play (bards and skalds often acquire it to recall poems and songs). 5 points.<br>
Photographic Memory: As above, but you automatically recall specific details, too. Any time you, the player forget a detail your character has seen or heard, the GM or other players must remind you - truthfully! 10 points.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>ELASTIC SKIN</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>20 points</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You can alter your skin and facial features (but not clothing or makeup) to duplicate those of another member of your race or a very similar race. This takes 10 seconds, and requires a Disguise roll if you try to duplicate a particular individual. It takes three seconds to return to your original form. This ability gives +4 to all Disguise rolls.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>EMPATHY</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>5 or 15 points</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You have a feeling for people. When you first meet someone - or are reunited after an absence - you may ask the GM to roll against your IQ. He will tell you what you feel about that person. On a failed IQ roll, he will lie! This talent is excellent for spotting impostors, possession, etc., and for determining the true loyalties of NPCs. You can also use it to determine whether someone is lying . . . not what the truth is, but just whether they are being truthful with you.<br>
This advantage works only on sapient (IQ 6+), natural beings. The equivalent talents for animals, plants, and supernatural entities are Animal Empathy (p. 40), Plant Empathy (p. 75), and Spirit Empathy (p. 88), respectively.<br>
This advantage comes in two levels:<br>
Sensitive: Your ability is not entirely reliable; the IQ roll is at -3. You get +1 to your Detect Lies and Fortune- Telling skills, and to Psychology rolls to analyze a subject you can converse with. 5 points.<br>
Empathy: Your ability works at full IQ, and the bonus to Detect Lies, Fortune-Telling, and Psychology is +3. 15 points.<br>
<hr>
</p><h3 class="card">Special Enhancements</h3><p class="card">
Remote: Your ability isn't limited to direct, personal meetings. You can read any subject you can see or hear - even over electronic media (or by supernatural means, for Spirit Empathy). +50%.<br>
Specialized: The Specialized limitations for Speak With Animals (see p. B87) and Speak With Plants (see p. 77) are equally valid on Animal Empathy and Plant Empathy, respectively. Spirit Empathy already includes this limitation.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>ENHANCED DEFENSES</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>Variable</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You are unusually adept at evading attacks! This may be due to careful observation of your foe, focusing chi, or anything else that fits your background.<br>
There are three versions:<br>
Enhanced Block: You have +1 to your Block score with either Cloak or Shield skill. You must specialize in one particular Block defense. 5 points.<br>
Enhanced Dodge: You have +1 to your Dodge score. 15 points.<br>
Enhanced Parry: You have +1 to your Parry score. You may take this advantage for bare hands (5 points), for any one Melee Weapon skill (5 points), or for all parries (10 points). 5 or 10 points.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>ENHANCED MOVE</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>20 points/level</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You can really move! Each level of Enhanced Move doubles your top speed in one environment: Air, Ground, Space, or Water. You may also take a half-level of Enhanced Move, either alone or with any whole number of levels; this costs 10 points and multiplies Move by 1.5.<br>
Example 1: A super buys Enhanced Move 4 (Ground), for 80 points. He multiplies his Move by 2 x 2 x 2 x 2  16. If his Basic Move were 8, he could run at 128 yards/second (262 mph).<br>
Example 2: An avian race has Enhanced Move 2.5 (Air), for 50 points. All members of the race multiply their top airspeed by 2 x 2 x 1.5 = 6.<br>
Your multiplied Move is your top speed. Record it in parentheses after your Enhanced Move trait; for instance, the super in the example above would write Enhanced Move 4 (Ground Speed 128). You can always choose to accept a slightly lower top speed if you want your speed to match that of a real-world or fictional creature or vehicle with a known top speed. This does not give you back any points.<br>
Enhanced Move does not affect Basic Speed, Basic Move, or Dodge. Its benefits apply only when moving along a relatively straight, smooth course (see Sprinting, p. 354). It does have some defensive value, however: those who attack you with ranged attacks must take your speed into account when calculating speed/range modifiers (see p. 550).<br>
Most forms of Enhanced Move have prerequisites. Enhanced Move (Water) requires Amphibious (p. 40) or Aquatic (p. 145). Enhanced Move (Air) requires Flight (p. 56). Enhanced Move (Space) requires Flight with the Space Flight or Newtonian Space Flight enhancement, and affects movement in space - not airspeed. To move faster in air and in space, buy both Enhanced Move (Air) and Enhanced Move (Space).<br>
Physiological: Adaptations such as fins, wings, or a streamlined body often imply such traits as Amphibious, Flight (Small Wings or Winged), and/or No Legs (Aerial or Aquatic), in addition to Enhanced Move. The fastest land creatures aren't bipeds, and tend to have Extra Legs - or possibly Extra Arms or Strikers. Creatures that can only use Enhanced Move for a short time before they tire should add Costs Fatigue (-5%/level).<br>
Technological: Wheels, tracks, jets, rockets, propellers, etc. are likely for robots and vehicles. Such options often suggest additional traits - No Legs (Wheeled) for wheels, Burning Attack for a rocket that doubles as a weapon, and so on. Many of them make the user obvious while in use, which is a Nuisance Effect (-5%).<br>
Superhuman: Those with powers often have more unusual justifications. These can be invisible (an ordinary- looking man who runs very fast, speedy psychokinetic levitation, etc.) or glaringly obvious (e.g., creating and gliding along a strip of ice). Costs Fatigue and Nuisance Effect are both appropriate.<br>
<hr>
</p><h3 class="card">Special Enhancements</h3><p class="card">
Handling Bonus: You get a bonus to DX or vehicle operation skill (e.g., Driving) for the sole purpose of maintaining control at speeds above your Basic Move. +5% per +1, to a maximum of +5.<br>
<hr>
</p><h3 class="card">Special Limitations</h3><p class="card">
Handling Penalty: You have a penalty to DX or vehicle operation skill at high speeds. -5% per -1, to a maximum of -5.<br>
Newtonian: This is a limitation for Enhanced Move (Space). Your space top speed is actually your delta-v: the total velocity change you can manage before running out of reaction mass. Once you have made velocity changes equal to your top speed, you must refuel before you can change velocity again. -50%.<br>
Road-Bound: This is a limitation for Enhanced Move (Ground). Your Enhanced Move is effective only on a smooth, flat surface, such as a road or building floor. This is often taken in conjunction with the Wheeled disadvantage (p. 145). -50%.<br>
All-Out: Moving fast requires your undivided attention! Using your ability is like making an All-Out Attack . . . but without the attack. You have no active defenses and can't Attack, Concentrate, Ready, etc. Explain what you're doing: flapping your wings, balancing on two wheels, diverting all your power to project a flame jet or ice path, or whatever else fits. This is worth less than the general All-Out modifier (p. 110), because it doesn't limit you to half your Move in a forward direction. -20%.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>ENHANCED TIME SENSE</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>45 points</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You can receive and process information dramatically faster than the human norm. This improves your mental speed - notably your reaction time - but not how fast you physically move once you react. This has several game benefits.<br>
First, Enhanced Time Sense (ETS) includes Combat Reflexes (p. 43), and provides all the benefits of that advantage. You cannot buy Combat Reflexes if you have ETS; the two advantages are not cumulative.<br>
In combat, you automatically act before those without ETS, regardless of Basic Speed. If more than one combatant has ETS, they act in order of Basic Speed, and they all get to act before those who lack ETS.<br>
You can perceive things that happen too fast for most people to discern. For example, you cannot be fooled by a projected image, because you can see the individual frames of the film. If secret information is being sent as a high-speed burst, you can detect it if you're monitoring the transmission (you cannot necessarily decipher it, but you know it's there). At the GM's discretion, you get a Sense roll to spot objects moving so fast that they are effectively invisible; for instance, bullets in flight. ETS is extremely valuable if you possess magical or psionic defenses that work at the speed of thought.<br>
If you have ETS, your rapid thought processes always allow you to ponder a problem thoroughly and respond in the manner you think best. You never suffer skill penalties for being mentally rushed - although you still need the usual amount of time to complete a physical task, and suffer the usual penalties for hasty work. The GM can almost never tell you to make up your mind right now. (But don't abuse this privilege by taking half an hour to decide what to do in each turn in combat!) <br>
The exception is when something happens so fast that most people can't perceive it at all. In that case, the GM is justified in asking you for an immediate response, since those without ETS get no response.<br>
ETS does not slow down the world from your viewpoint. You can still enjoy a movie by simply ignoring the frames, much as a literate person can choose whether or not to notice the individual letters in the words he's reading. ETS also does not let you violate the laws of physics. Some things (e.g., laser beams) simply travel too fast for you to react.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>ENHANCED TRACKING</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>5 points/level</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You can track more than one target - whether with a built-in sensor array or eyes that can swivel independently, like those of a chameleon. An Aim (p. 364) or Evaluate (p. 364) maneuver normally applies to a single target. Each level of Enhanced Tracking allows your maneuver to apply to one additional target. You can only track targets that you can detect, and you cannot Aim at more targets than you have ready weapons to Aim with.<br>
Multiple Lock-Ons: You can track multiple targets even if you have only one weapon, and gain the benefit of your Aim or Evaluate maneuver if you attack any of them. Use this to represent high-tech sensors and the situational awareness of cinematic warriors. +20%.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>EXTENDED LIFESPAN</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>2 points/level</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>An average life cycle is defined as maturity at age 18, with aging effects (see p. 444) starting at age 50 and accelerating at ages 70 and 90. Each level of Extended Lifespan doubles all these values. Note that if you need to take more than seven levels of this trait (giving maturity at age 2,304 and the onset of aging at age 6,400), it is more efficient to take Unaging (p. 95).</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>EXTRA ARMS</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>Variable</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>In GURPS, a limb with which you can manipulate objects is an arm, regardless of where it grows or what it looks like. A normal arm can strike a blow that inflicts thrust-1 crushing damage based on ST. The human norm is two arms for 0 points. Extra arms have a base cost of 10 points apiece.<br>
Coordination<br>
You can use extra arms freely for multiple noncombat tasks. For instance, with three arms, you could perform a one-handed task (e.g., use a computer mouse) and a two-handed task (e.g., type) simultaneously. You need Enhanced Tracking (p. 53) to perform tasks that require attention to events in more than one place at a time, however.<br>
You can also use all of your arms in concert for a single combat maneuver where extra arms would be helpful; e.g., grappling in close combat. And if you have at least three arms, you can use a shield normally with one arm and still wield a two-handed weapon, just as a normal human fighter can use a shield and one-handed weapon at the same time.<br>
No matter how many arms you have, though, you do not get additional attacks (or other extra maneuvers) in combat unless you buy Extra Attacks (see below).<br>
Close Combat With Extra Arms<br>
Extra arms give a huge advantage in close combat. You cannot punch with more than one arm at a time unless you have Extra Attack, but you may grapple with all of your arms at once. Each extra arm of regular length or longer, over and above the generic set of two, gives +2 to any attempt to grapple or break free from a grapple. Having more arms than your opponent also gives +3 on any attempt to pin or resist a pin.<br>
<hr>
</p><h3 class="card">Special Enhancements</h3><p class="card">
Extra-Flexible: Limbs with this enhancement are more flexible than human arms, like tentacles or an elephant's trunk. These limbs can always reach and work with other limbs, regardless of body positioning, general layout, or right and left. +50%.<br>
Long: Your arm is longer in proportion to your body than a human arm relative to the human body. This increases your effective SM for the purpose of calculating reach with that arm (see Size Modifier and Reach, p. 402). This does affect the reach of melee weapons wielded in that hand. Each +1 to SM also adds +1 per die to swinging damage. +100% per +1 to SM.<br>
<hr>
</p><h3 class="card">Special Limitations</h3><p class="card">
Foot Manipulators: Your arm is really an unusually dextrous leg. You cannot walk while you are manipulating objects with it (although you can sit, float, or fly). This is a Temporary Disadvantage limitation, the disadvantage being Legless (p. 141). This kind of arm is usually - but not always - Short (see below). -30%.<br>
No Physical Attack: The limb can manipulate but cannot punch or wield melee weapons, and gives no bonus in close combat. It can still wield a firearm or similar ranged weapon. -50%.<br>
Short: The arm has reach C (close combat only), and lacks the leverage to use any weapon that must be swung. Subtract one yard from the reach of any melee weapon wielded by that limb. If all of your arms are short, you are at -2 on any attempt to grapple. -50%.<br>
Weak: The arm has less than your full body ST for lifting, striking, and grappling. -25% if the arm has half your body ST, or -50% if it has 1/4 your body ST (round down in both cases).<br>
Weapon Mount: Instead of an arm, you have a hardpoint where you can mount a weapon. This may be biological, mechanical, or a hybrid of the two, depending on whether you are a living being, a machine, or a cyborg. You cannot use this mount for any purpose other than bearing a weapon. This limitation is incompatible with Feet Manipulator, No Physical Attack, Short, and Weak. -80%. Modifying Beings With One or Two Arms Beings with one or two arms can use the special modifiers above. Point cost is equal to 1/10 the percentile modifier per affected arm. Thus, enhancements become advantages and limitations become disadvantages. For instance, Short is -50%, so it is worth -5 points per arm. Someone with two short arms would have a -10- point disadvantage. Those with one arm can only apply these modifiers once, but also get the -20 points for One Arm (p. 147). For instance, an elephant's trunk would be Extra-Flexible (+50%), Long (+100%), and Weak (-50%). These modifiers total +100%, for a 10-point advantage. The -20 points for One Arm would make the net cost -10 points.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>EXTRA ATTACK</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>25 points/attack</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You can attack more than once per turn. The default assumption in GURPS is that you can make one attack per turn, no matter how many limbs you have. Each Extra Attack allows one additional attack per turn. You may not have more attacks than you have limbs (arms, legs, etc.), natural weapons (Strikers, Teeth, etc.), and attack powers (Afflictions, Bindings, and Innate Attacks) with which to attack. The GM's word on what constitutes an attack is final.<br>
A normal human can purchase one Extra Attack. This lets him attack with both hands at once, and represents unusually good coordination. Supers and nonhumans have no such limitation. A super-powered cop could buy two Extra Attacks, enabling him to shoot rays from his eyes, fire his pistol, and swing his nightstick all at once. A dragon might take four Extra Attacks and attack five times with any combination of his four clawed limbs, teeth, horns, tail, and fiery breath!<br>
Extra Attack is exactly that: an extra Attack maneuver on your turn in combat. It does not eliminate the -4 penalty for an off hand (see Ambidexterity, p. 39) or let you take multiple Aim maneuvers (see Enhanced Tracking, p. 53). You may use some of your attacks for Feint maneuvers, but you many not take multiple actions of other kinds - that requires Altered Time Rate (p. 38).<br>
<hr>
Extra Attacks and All-Out Attack<br>
When an individual with Extra Attacks makes an All-Out Attack, he must select one type of bonus for all his attacks that turn. He could not, for instance, take All-Out Attack (Determined) with one attack and All- Out Attack (Strong) with another. If he chooses All-Out Attack (Double) to increase his number of attacks, he gets one additional attack.<br>
<hr>
Extra Attacks and Rapid Strike<br>
You may use one of your melee attacks to make a Rapid Strike (see p. 370) on your turn, at the usual penalty. Your remaining attacks are in addition to this Rapid Strike, and receive no penalty. You may not use Rapid Strike with two or more attacks in one turn.<br>
Multi-Strike: You can strike more than once with the same weapon or body part. This means you can launch more attacks than you have limbs, natural weapons, and attack abilities. You can use your best attack multiple times. +20%.<br>
Single Skill: Your Extra Attacks apply only to a particular combat skill. For instance, Extra Attack 2 (Single Skill, Karate) lets you attack three times - but at least two of the attacks must be with the Karate skill. To attack more than once using a weapon skill, you need either one weapon per attack or the Multi- Strike enhancement. -20%.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>EXTRA HEAD</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>15 points/head</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You have more than one head, each with fully functional ears, eyes, mouth, etc. Each Extra Head gives you one Extra Mouth (p. 55) and one level of Enhanced Tracking (p. 53) at no extra charge. Each head also contains an extra brain with a complete copy of your memories, personality, and skills. These extra brains are backups, however, and do not grant additional mental actions - for that, take Compartmentalized Mind (p. 43). You cannot suffer more than 2 x (your HP/number of heads) points of injury from any single attack to your head or neck. Any head blow that causes unconsciousness only knocks out that one head; the others continue to function! A critical head blow that would normally kill you simply destroys that head, inflicting the maximum injury noted above and crushing, severing, or exploding the head (GM's option).<br>
<hr>
</p><h3 class="card">Special Limitations</h3><p class="card">
Extraneous: Your Extra Head grants Extra Mouth and Enhanced Tracking, but does not contain a backup brain. A single blow to an Extraneous head can do no more than HP/(1.5 x number of heads) points of injury, but blows to your real head can cause stun, knockout, or death even if your other heads are unharmed. -20%.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>EXTRA LEGS</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>Variable</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>If you can walk on a limb but cannot use it to manipulate objects, it is a leg in GURPS (for legs that double as arms, see Extra Arms, p. 53). A normal leg can kick for thrust/crushing damage at your usual reach (1 yard for a human). The human norm is two legs, which costs 0 points. It costs points to have more than two legs:<br>
Three or four legs: If you lose a leg, you can continue to move at half Move (round down). Loss of a second leg causes you to fall. 5 points.<br>
Five or six legs: Each leg lost reduces Move by 20% until only three legs are left. At that point, your Move is 40% normal. Loss of another leg causes you to fall. 10 points.<br>
Seven or more legs: Each leg lost reduces Move by 10% until only three legs are left. At that point, your Move is 40% normal. Loss of another leg causes you to fall. 15 points.<br>
You can apply the following modifiers to all your legs:<br>
<hr>
</p><h3 class="card">Special Enhancements</h3><p class="card">
Long: Your legs are longer in proportion to your body than human legs relative to the human body. This increases your effective SM for the purpose of calculating reach when kicking (see Size Modifier and Reach, p. 402) and when clambering over obstacles. +100% per +1 to SM.<br>
<hr>
</p><h3 class="card">Special Limitations</h3><p class="card">
Cannot Kick: You cannot use your legs to kick for damage. -50%. Modifying Beings With Two Legs The modifiers above can be applied to creatures with only two legs. Point cost is equal to 1/10 the percentile modifier. For instance, a human with Cannot Kick (-50%) would have a -5- point disadvantage.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>EXTRA LIFE</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>25 points/life</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You can come back from the dead! No matter how sure your foes were that they killed you, you didn't really die. Work out the details with the GM. Every time you come back from the dead, you use up one Extra Life - remove it from your character sheet and reduce your point total by 25 points. The GM may wish to let players spend earned points to buy Extra Lives in play.<br>
<hr>
</p><h3 class="card">Special Limitations</h3><p class="card">
Copy: When you die, you revert to a backup copy. To create this copy takes minutes or hours, possibly at a special facility. Details are up to the GM. Make a copy of your character sheet whenever you update your backup. If you die, you revert to those statistics, losing any traits or character points acquired since then. Note that a copy exists before you die. You must tell the GM where you store it. You will return to life at that location . . . and if your enemies discover where you store your copy, they may tamper with it! -20%.<br>
Requires Body: You come back in disembodied state - for instance, as a spirit or a digital copy on a computer. All your experiences and abilities are intact (unless you took Copy), but you cannot interact with the physical world at all until you acquire a new body. This might be a clone, an undead corpse, or even a robot shell. -20%, or -40% if the required body is illegal, rare, or expensive (GM's decision).</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>EXTRA MOUTH</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>5 points/mouth</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You have more than one functional mouth, which can be anywhere on your body. All of your mouths are capable of breathing, eating, and speaking. An Extra Mouth lets you bite more than once if you have Extra Attacks (p. 53). If you have Compartmentalized Mind (p. 43), you can carry on multiple conversations, or cast two spells that require spoken words. Other benefits include being hard to silence or suffocate, and being able to sing in harmony with yourself!</p,></div></div>

<div><h2 class='points'>5 points</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>Your look is always one step ahead of the crowd. You have the ability to create a fashion statement out of the cheapest and most nondescript materials. This gives +1 to reaction rolls in social situations when you have a chance to plan your attire in advance. You can also give someone else a +1 reaction bonus when you put together the outfit.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>FAVOR</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>Variable</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You saved someone's life, kept silent at the right time, or otherwise did someone a good turn. Now he owes you one.<br>
A Favor is a one-shot Ally, Contact, Contact Group, or Patron. Work out the point cost of the parent advantage, and then divide it by 5 (round up) to get the cost of the Favor. The catch is that the NPC(s) in question will help you out once . . . and only once.<br>
When you wish to collect on your Favor, the GM rolls against the frequency of appearance of the underlying advantage. On a failure, you couldn't reach your friend in time, or he couldn't comply, but you still have your Favor coming. You may try again on a later adventure.<br>
On a success, you get what you want (subject to the limits of the advantage). But this discharges the obligation: remove the Favor from your character sheet and reduce your point total appropriately. However, if the roll is a 3 or 4, your friend still feels indebted to you, and you retain the Favor . . . at least until next time.<br>
You may buy a Favor in play, just like any trait of this kind. The GM may also wish to include a Favor as part of the reward for a successful adventure.</p,></div></div>

This comes in two levels, In both cases, this advantage applies only to FP lost to exertion, heat, etc. It has no effect on FP spent to power psi or magic spells:<br>
Fit: You get +1 to all HT rolls (to stay conscious, avoid death, resist disease or poison, etc.). This does not improve your HT attribute or HTbased skills! You also recover FP at twice the normal rate. 5 points.<br>
Very Fit: As above, but the bonus to HT rolls is +2. In addition, you lose FP at only half the normal rate. 15 points.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>FLEXIBILITY</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>5 or 15 points</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>Your body is unusually flexible.<br>
This advantage comes in two levels:<br>
Flexibility: You get +3 on Climbing rolls; on Escape rolls to get free of ropes, handcuffs, and similar restraints; on Erotic Art skill; and on all attempts to break free in close combat (see p. 391). You may ignore up to -3 in penalties for working in close quarters (including many Explosives and Mechanic rolls). 5 points.<br>
Double-Jointed: As above, but more so. You cannot stretch or squeeze yourself abnormally, but any part of your body may bend any way. You get +5 on Climbing, Erotic Art, and Escape rolls, and on attempts to break free. You may ignore up to -5 in penalties for close quarters. 15 points.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>FLIGHT</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>40 points</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You can fly. The default is fullfledged, self-powered flight without wings or gliding surfaces. This works at any altitude where there is still significant atmosphere - but in the upper atmosphere, you'll need a way to survive in very thin, cold air (e.g., Doesn't Breathe and Temperature Tolerance). You cannot fly in a trace atmosphere or vacuum.<br>
Your flight Move is Basic Speed x 2 (drop all fractions). As explained in Move in Other Environments (p. 18), you can adjust this for ±2 points per ±1 yard/second. For very high speeds, take Enhanced Move (Air). If you do not have any of the Controlled Gliding, Gliding, Lighter Than Air, Small Wings, Space Flight Only, or Winged Flight limitations, you can also fly at half-speed underwater. Flight includes the ability to hover at Move 0 as well.<br>
Flight does not confer the ability to do complex acrobatics and tight turns; for that, buy Aerobatics skill (p. 174). Flight skill (p. 195) improves endurance.<br>
You can alter most of the above assumptions through special modifiers.<br>
<hr>
</p><h3 class="card">Special Enhancements</h3><p class="card">
Newtonian Space Flight: As Space Flight (below), except that your space Move - or your space top speed, if you have Enhanced Move (Space) - is actually your delta-v: the total velocity change you can manage in space before running out of reaction mass. For instance, you could accelerate up to your delta-v and stay there (like a missile), or to half your delta-v and then decelerate to a stop at the end of your trip (like a conventional spacecraft). Once you have made velocity changes equal to your delta-v, you must refuel before you can change your velocity in space again. +25%.<br>
Space Flight: You can fly in space or a vacuum (such as on the moon). Your space Move is Basic Speed x 2. If you want to be able to accelerate constantly to reach a higher top speed, like a rocket, buy Enhanced Move (Space) (p. 52). This will let you accelerate or decelerate each turn by an amount equal to your space Move, up to your enhanced top speed. For a realistic space move that lets you accelerate indefinitely in a vacuum (up to the speed of light), you'll want Enhanced Move 25-27 (Space). This is incompatible with all other special modifiers except Space Flight Only. +50%.<br>
<hr>
</p><h3 class="card">Special Limitations</h3><p class="card">
Cannot Hover: You must always move at least 1/4 your top airspeed (round up) when flying. This is incompatible with Controlled Gliding and Gliding. -15%.<br>
Controlled Gliding: Like Gliding (below) in most respects, but you can gain altitude by riding updrafts or thermals. A typical ascent rate is one yard per second. You can locate thermals, if any are present, on a successful IQ or Meteorology roll (one attempt per minute). -45%.<br>
Gliding: You cannot gain altitude. With a running leap, you can launch yourself with an air Move equal to Basic Move. Each turn, you can change velocity by up to 10 yards/second x local gravity in Gs (Earth's gravity is 1G). To accelerate, you must descend by 1 yard for each 1 yard/second added to velocity; top speed is Basic Move x 4 (but you can go faster if towed). To decelerate, you must fly level. If you do not descend at least 1 yard, you automatically decelerate by 1 yard/second that turn. When working out turning radius, your basic air Move is 10 x local gravity in Gs. Each level of Enhanced Move (Air) either doubles top speed or halves deceleration in level flight (e.g., one level means you only lose 0.5 yard/second in level flight); specify which when you buy it. -50%.<br>
Lighter Than Air: You fly by becoming lighter than air (or gaseous). A wind moves you 1 yard/second, in the direction it is blowing, per 5 mph of wind speed. If the wind happens to be blowing in the direction you wish to travel, this adds to your Move; otherwise, your Move goes down as you fight against the breeze. -10%.<br>
Low Ceiling: You cannot fly very high. This does not limit speed in any way, but the GM may require Aerobatics rolls to dodge obstacles near the ground. A 30-foot ceiling is -10%; a 10-foot ceiling is -20%; and a 5-foot ceiling is -25%.<br>
Small Wings: As Winged (below), except that your wingspan is no more than half your height. You use your wings to steer and to stabilize your flight - not to lift. If your wings are crippled in flight, roll against Aerobatics skill (or default) to land safely. -10%.<br>
Space Flight Only: You can only take this in conjunction with Space Flight or Newtonian Space Flight. You can fly only in space; you have air Move 0 in atmosphere. You require a boost to reach space from any planet with an atmosphere, and are incapable of atmospheric reentry. -75%.<br>
Winged: You use large wings or skin flaps to fly. Wingspan is at least twice your height. In order to take off, land, or maneuver, you must have an open area with a radius equal to your wingspan in all directions. If your wings are bound, or if a wing is crippled (more than 1/3 of your wings, if you have more than two), you cannot fly. Treat wings as arms for the purpose of targeting and crippling. If you wish to strike blows or manipulate objects with your wings, you must pay for them as Strikers or Extra Arms in addition to the cost of Flight. -25%.<br>
Planetary: Your Flight works by pushing off against a planet's gravitational or magnetic field. It's useless in the absence of a planet. This is incompatible with all types of Space Flight. -5%.<br>
Requires Surface: You fly by pushing off of surfaces. You can stay airborne for at most five seconds. After that, you must push off again by moving close enough to a rigid surface (wall, bamboo cane, etc.) - or any surface, even water, in a cinematic game - to touch it with part of your body. This doesn't require a maneuver. Otherwise, you start to fall! -20%.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>FUR</h1></div>

<div><p class='card'>You have fur. This prevents sunburn. Thicker fur might justify 1-3 levels each of Damage Resistance (p. 46) and Temperature Tolerance (p. 93), while spiky “fur” might grant Spines (p. 88). You must buy these other traits separately.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>GADGETEER</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>25 or 50 points</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You are a natural inventor. You can modify existing equipment and - given sufficient time and money - invent entirely new gadgets as described under Gadgeteering (p. 475). This lets you design gadgets quickly, and makes it easy to realize higher-TL innovations. This advantage comes in two levels:<br>
Gadgeteer: You are a cinematic gadgeteer, but your work still takes days or months, and requires a good deal of money and expensive equipment. 25 points.<br>
Quick Gadgeteer: You can throw together wondrous gadgets in minutes or hours, and can get by with scrounged-together spare parts that cost a few percent of what a realistic inventor would have to spend. This level is definitely unsuitable for realistic campaigns! 50 points.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>G-EXPERIENCE</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>1 to 10 points</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You have experience working in one or more gravitational fields other than your native one, and your reflexes adapt quickly to the way objects move and fall in those fields. You suffer only half the usual DX penalty for different gravity (see Different Gravity, p. 350). In situations where low gravity would make a task easier, you roll at full DX, plus the bonus for low gravity, plus an extra +1. For instance, if a normal person would get +2 to catch a ball in low gravity, you would get +3.<br>
This trait costs 1 point per gravity field with which you have experience. For instance, an Earth native who works on the moon might have G-Experience (0.16G). To enjoy the benefits of G-Experience in all gravity fields, buy G-Experience (All) for 10 points.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>GIZMOS</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>5 points/gizmo</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You always seem to have just the piece of gear you need. Once per game session per level of this advantage, you may pull out one small item of equipment that you could have been carrying. This Gizmo remains undefined until you reveal it. It does not even enter play until you take it out; thus, it cannot be damaged, lost, stolen, or found in a search.<br>
A Gizmo must be small enough to fit in an ordinary coat pocket, and must meet one of three criteria:<br>
1. An item you own but did not specifically state you were carrying. For instance, if you own a handgun, and get ambushed while driving to church, you could pull out your pistol - even if the police searched your vehicle five minutes ago and found no weapons! <br>
2. An item that you probably own, and that is in keeping with your character concept, but that is minor or ignorable enough to leave unspecified. For instance, a policeman might happen to be carrying a spare handcuff key, while a wizard might have some eye of newt. The GM has the final say, but should be lenient if the item you wish to have is consistent with your character story.<br>
3. An inexpensive device widely available at your tech level. For instance, if you need to light the fuse on some dynamite, you could pull out a box of matches - and they would work, even if you just took an involuntary swim in the creek.<br>
Each Gizmo you can use per game session (maximum of three) costs 5 points. Note that this ability is not realistic! The GM may wish to limit it further, or forbid it, in a realistic campaign.<br>
<hr>
Gadgeteers and Gizmos<br>
Those with the Gadgeteer advantage (p. 56) have more latitude. In addition to the usual items available, a Gadgeteer may specify that his Gizmo is one of his inventions (which must still be small). Instead of pulling an existing gadget out of his pocket, a Gadgeteer can use his Gizmo to let him build what he needs on the spot.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>GROWTH</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>10 points/level</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You can grow - really grow! As your size increases, so must your ST (or you would collapse under your own weight). Your equipment doesn't change size!<br>
Each level of Growth lets you increase your Size Modifier by +1. Find your final height from the Size Modifier Table (p. 19). Increases in SM affect your arm and leg length when calculating reach and determining whether you can negotiate obstacles; see Size Modifier and Reach (p. 402). It takes one second to modify your SM by +1 (or by -1 as you return to normal size).<br>
If you attempt to grow in a room, vehicle, container, etc. that isn't large enough to hold you, your growth normally stops. However, if maximum thrust damage for your current ST is greater than the wall or ceiling's DR, you burst through it. This takes one second per point of DR.<br>
You must buy the ST necessary to support your form separately. This is 5 x final height in yards. If your ST increases with height and is only available when you grow, you may buy it with the Size limitation (see Strength, p. 14). Use your maximum SM to determine the limitation value. At intermediate SMs, find your height as a fraction of your maximum height. This is the fraction of your extra ST available to you at that SM (round down).<br>
Example: A 6'-tall character (SM 0) has Growth 4. He can grow to SM +4, giving him a maximum height of 10 yards. He must buy ST 50 to support himself. If he has ST 15 and gains +35 ST only at full height, he may buy his +35 ST with a -40% Size limitation. At SM +1, he will be 3 yards tall. This is 30% of his final height, so he will have 30% of +35 ST, or +10 ST, for ST 25. Similarly, he'll be 5 yards tall with ST 32 at SM +2, 7 yards tall with ST 39 at SM +3, and 10 yards tall with ST 50 at SM +4.<br>
Maximum Size Only: You can only assume normal or maximum size. Instead of growing at +1 SM per second, you grow to your maximum SM - or revert back to your usual SM - in one second. The limitation of no intermediate SMs (restricting your use of this ability in close quarters) cancels out the enhancement of rapid growth (a useful benefit in combat). +0%.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>GUNSLINGER</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>25 points</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You can make uncannily precise shots without aiming. This ability works with any weapon that uses Beam Weapons, Gunner, Guns, or Liquid Projector skill. It gives no bonuses when using muscle-powered missile weapons (but the GM is free to introduce a low-tech version that works with Blowpipe, Bow, Crossbow, Sling, etc.).<br>
When firing single shots (RoF 1-3) from a one-handed weapon, you get the Accuracy bonus of your weapon without the need for an Aim maneuver. When using a two-handed weapon or automatic fire, you get half the Accuracy bonus (round up) without the need to Aim. If you do Aim, you always get full Acc, and bracing, scopes, and additional seconds of Aim provide the usual benefits.<br>
This ability is intended for cinematic games with an action movie ambience. The GM may wish to forbid it in a completely realistic campaign.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>HARD TO KILL</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>2 points/level</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You are incredibly difficult to kill. Each level of Hard to Kill gives +1 to HT rolls made for survival at -HP or below, and on any HT roll where failure means instant death (due to heart failure, poison, etc.). If this bonus makes the difference between success and failure, you collapse, apparently dead (or disabled), but come to in the usual amount of time - see Recovering from Unconsciousness (p. 423). A successful Diagnosis roll (or a Mechanic roll, for machines) reveals the truth.<br>
Example: Bruno has HT 12, 15 HP, and Hard to Kill 4. He takes 45 points of damage, which reduces him to -30 HP. He must make two HT rolls to survive: one at -15 HP, one at -30 HP. He rolls an 11 for the first one, but on the second roll, he gets a 14. This is above his HT (12), but below his modified HT (12 + 4  16). He passes out, and his foes leave him for dead. Roughly a day later, he'll regain consciousness - injured, but not dead!<br>
In a realistic campaign, the GM may wish to limit characters to Hard to Kill 1 or 2.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>HARD TO SUBDUE</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>2 points/level</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You are hard to knock out. Each level of Hard to Subdue gives +1 to any HT roll to avoid unconsciousness - whether as a result of injury, drugs, or ultra-tech weapons - and to resist supernatural abilities that cause unconsciousness. In a realistic campaign, the GM may wish to limit characters to Hard to Subdue 1 or 2.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>HEALING</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>30 points</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You have the ability to heal others. You must be in physical contact with the subject. To activate your power, concentrate for one second and make an IQ roll. Roll at -2 if the subject is unconscious.<br>
You can use Healing in two ways:<br>
Heal Injuries: On a success, you can heal any number of HP. This costs you 1 FP per 2 HP healed (round up). Failure costs 1d FP, but you can try again; critical failure also causes the recipient 1d damage. Even 1 HP of healing will stop bleeding. By rolling at -6, you can repair a crippled but whole limb if you completely heal the HP lost to the crippling injury. For instance, to heal a hand crippled by 4 points of damage, make an IQ-6 roll and spend 2 FP. Each healer gets only one attempt per crippled limb. Healing cannot restore lost limbs or bring back the dead.<br>
Cure Disease: This requires an IQ roll at a modifier determined by the GM - from +1 for the common cold to -15 for AIDS. The FP cost is equal to twice the penalty, minimum 1 FP. For instance, it would cost 6 FP to cure a disease that calls for an IQ-3 roll.<br>
If used more than once per day on a given subject, apply a cumulative -3 per successful healing of the same type (injury or disease) on that subject. This penalty accumulates until a full day has passed since the most recent healing.<br>
Healing works on your own race and on all similar races. In a fantasy campaign, for instance, all warmblooded humanoid races (elves, dwarves, orcs, halflings, etc.) would be similar.<br>
<hr>
</p><h3 class="card">Special Enhancements</h3><p class="card">
Faith Healing: Your power works by channeling spiritual energy. This lets you cure anyone the spirits or gods deem worthy of healing, regardless of race. However, you (and possibly your subject) must behave in a manner consistent with the interests and moral codes of your supernatural allies, or this ability will not work. You may not combine Faith Healing with Own Race Only or Xenohealing. +20%.<br>
Xenohealing: You can heal beings quite dissimilar from yourself. Examples, assuming you are human: All Mammals, +20%; All Earthly Life, +40%; All Carbon-Based Life, +60%; Anything Alive, +80%; Anything Animate (including undead, golems, etc.), +100%.<br>
Affects Self: You can also heal yourself, provided you're conscious. Shock penalties apply to any Healing roll made on the turn after you're wounded. +50%.<br>
Cure Affliction: You can neutralize ongoing Afflictions - including the Affliction-like effects of the Side Effect and Symptoms enhancements. This requires an IQ roll at -1 per full +50% the target effect is worth as an enhancement to Affliction. FP cost is equal to twice the penalty, minimum 1 FP. For instance, blindness is a +50% Disadvantage enhancement, so to cure blindness caused by Affliction, Side Effect, or Symptoms would require a roll at -1 and cost 2 FP. +60%.<br>
<hr>
</p><h3 class="card">Special Limitations</h3><p class="card">
Disease Only: You can only cure disease. -40%.<br>
Injuries Only: You can only heal injuries. -20%.<br>
Own Race Only: This is only available in campaigns with multiple sapient races. -20%.<br>
Psychic Healing: Your ability is part of the Psychic Healing psi power (see p. 256). -10%.<br>
Affliction Only: You can only neutralize Afflictions, as described for Cure Affliction; you can't heal injury or cure disease. -40%.<br>
Capped: You can spend only a limited number of FP per use. This limits the severity of the diseases you can cure, requires multiple uses to heal serious injuries (taking extra time and incurring the usual -3 per previous successful healing), and may prevent you from repairing crippled limbs. This is worth -25% for a cap of 2 FP, -20% for 4 FP, -15% for 6 FP, -10% for 8 FP, and -5% for 10 FP. More than 10 FP isn't an appreciable limitation.<br>
Empathic: When you heal others, you take on the injuries, diseases, and Afflictions you remove instead of paying FP. These affect you even if you have specific immunities to them. They get better at the usual natural rate unless cured via medicine or a special ability (e.g., you might transfer your wounds to someone else with Leech). Empathic is incompatible with Capped. -50%.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>HERMAPHROMORPH</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>5 points</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You can switch among fully functional neuter, male, and female forms. The process takes 10 seconds (Preparation Required, Takes Extra Time, and Takes Recharge are common limitations).</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>HIGH MANUAL DEXTERITY</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>5 points/level</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You have remarkably fine motor skills. Each level (to a maximum of four) gives +1 to DX for tasks that require a delicate touch. This includes all DX-based rolls against Artist, Jeweler, Knot-Tying, Leatherworking, Lockpicking, Pickpocket, Sewing, Sleight of Hand, and Surgery, as well as DX-based rolls to do fine work with Machinist or Mechanic (e.g., on clockwork). This bonus doesn't apply to IQbased tasks or large-scale DX-based tasks, nor does it apply to combatrelated die rolls of any kind.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>HIGH PAIN THRESHOLD</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>10 points</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You are as susceptible to injury as anyone else, but you don't feel it as much. You never suffer a shock penalty when you are injured. In addition, you get +3 on all HT rolls to avoid knockdown and stunning - and if you are tortured physically, you get +3 to resist. The GM may let you roll at Will+3 to ignore pain in other situations.<br>
High Pain Threshold is included in Supernatural Durability (p. 89); if you have the latter advantage, you cannot take this one.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>HIGH TL</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>5 points/TL above campaign TL</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>Your personal TL is above that of the campaign world. You may enter play with skills relating to equipment up to your personal TL. This is most useful if you also have access to highTL equipment (see Tech Level and Equipment,p.27), but the knowledge of a high-tech doctor or scientist can be very useful in a low-tech setting, even without specialized equipment!</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>HIGHER PURPOSE</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>5 points</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You are driven to exceed your normal limits in one specific pursuit. You must state this exactly as if it were a Code of Honor disadvantage (p. 127): Defend all women, Slay all demons, etc. If, in the GM's judgment, you are unfaltering in your pursuit of your Higher Purpose, you get +1 to all die rolls that pertain directly to the pursuit of your cause. If you deviate from your Higher Purpose, you lose this bonus . . . and the GM is free to penalize you for bad roleplaying just as if you had ignored a Code of Honor.<br>
A Higher Purpose must be specific. Higher Purposes such as Fight evil or Oppose authority figures are too broad to be balanced. In addition, a Higher Purpose must entail genuine risk and inconvenience. The GM should not allow pragmatic Higher Purposes like Faithfully serve my superiors. All Higher Purposes are subject to GM approval.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>HONEST FACE</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>1 point</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You simply look honest, reliable, or generally harmless. This has nothing to do with your reputation among those who know you, or how virtuous you really are! People who don’t know you will tend to pick you as the one to confide in, or not to pick you if they are looking for a potential criminal or troublemaker. You won’t be spotchecked by customs agents and the like unless they have another reason to suspect you, or unless they are truly choosing at random. You have a +1 to trained Acting skill for the sole purpose of “acting innocent.”</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>HYPERSPECTRAL VISION</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>25 points</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>Your vision extends across the infrared, visible, and ultraviolet portions of the spectrum. This integrated picture often reveals details that are invisible to those who merely possess normal vision, Infravision (p. 60), or Ultravision (p. 94).<br>
Hyperspectral Vision grants nearperfect night vision: you suffer no vision or combat penalties if there is any light at all. In total darkness, it functions exactly like Infravision. This trait also gives +3 on all Vision rolls; on all rolls to spot hidden clues or objects with Forensics, Observation, or Search skill; and on all Tracking rolls.<br>
If you possess Hyperspectral Vision, you cannot also have Infravision or Ultravision. This trait is essentially a higher level of both those advantages. Its game effects replace the specific effects of those traits.<br>
As described, this trait emulates realistic TL7+ sensors. The GM may permit supers to take the two special enhancements below. Neither is appropriate for real-world sensors!<br>
Extended Low-Band: You perceive radiation below the infrared, allowing you to see microwave, radar, and radio sources. This gives no special ability to understand radio signals! +30%.<br>
Extended High-Band: You sense radiation above the ultraviolet, allowing you to see X-ray and gamma ray sources. +30%.<br>
Extended (Special): You can perceive and see by non-electromagnetic radiation. This is mainly useful in science- fiction settings that feature weird radiation . . . or in worlds where magic, psi, and the like emit rays of eldritch power. +30% per added class of radiation.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>ILLUMINATED</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>15 points</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You are an Illuminatus in the original sense of the word - you are enlightened. You know what's going on, and you know it intuitively.<br>
You can discern other Illuminati on sight, with no possibility of error. Furthermore, whenever the GM requires a roll against a skill such as Current Affairs, Hidden Lore, or Intelligence Analysis to tell whether a certain strange occurrence is truly a coincidence or the result of a conspiracy, you may roll against the higher of your IQ and the specific skill in question. Finally, you can perceive and communicate with supernatural beings who are tied to Illuminated conspiracies in your game world (GM's decision). This gives you no special ability to control them, but they recognize you and treat you with a certain respect: +3 on reaction rolls.<br>
The only drawback is that other Illuminati and spiritual beings are able to perceive your Illuminated nature, and there's nothing you can do about it except stay out of sight.<br>
This advantage is best suited to mystical or fantastic campaigns. It is rarely appropriate in mundane conspiracy campaigns. The GM is the final judge of who may possess this trait.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>IMPROVED G-TOLERANCE</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>5 to 25 points</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You can function under a wide range of gravities. For a normal human, the penalties for non-native gravity accrue in increments of 0.2G; see Different Gravity (p. 350). A larger increment costs points: 5 points for 0.3G, 10 points for 0.5G, 15 points for 1G, 20 points for 5G, and 25 points for 10G. Normal humans are limited to 10 points in this trait.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>INDEPENDENT INCOME</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>1 point/level</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You have a source of income that does not require you to work: stock portfolio, trust fund, rental property, royalties, pension, etc. Your monthly income is 1% of your starting wealth (adjusted for wealth level) per level of this trait, to a maximum of 20%. If your income derives from investments, you need not specify their value; this trait assumes that you cannot or will not invade your capital.<br>
This trait is unrelated to wealth level. A Filthy Rich heiress has Independent Income . . . but so do an Average pensioner and a Poor welfare recipient.<br>
Independent Income most often means your occupation is something like dilettante, retiree, or welfare recipient – not an actual “job.” However, you can have Independent Income and a job; just add the income from both sources. If you are wealthy, this allows you to work less than full time (e.g., 10 hours per week instead of 40, for 1/4 the usual salary) and still make a good living.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>INDOMITABLE</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>15 points</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You are impossible to influence through ordinary words or actions. Those who wish to use Influence skills on you (see Influence Rolls, p. 359) must possess a suitable advantage:<br>
Empathy (p. 51) if you are a human or similar being, Animal Empathy (p. 40) if you're a beast, Plant Empathy (p. 75) if you're a plant, or Spirit Empathy (p. 88) if you're a demon, ghost, etc. Everyone else - however convincing - fails automatically. This trait often accompanies Unfazeable (p. 95).</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>INFRAVISION</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>0 or 10 points</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You can see into the infrared portion of the spectrum, allowing you to detect varying degrees of heat. This lets you fight at no penalty even in absolute darkness, if your target emits heat (this includes all living beings and most machines). It also gives you +2 on all Vision rolls to spot such targets, since their heat stands out from the background. You can follow a heat trail when tracking: add +3 to Tracking rolls if the trail is no more than an hour old.<br>
Infravision does not let you distinguish colors, and only allows you to judge the general size and shape of heat-emitting objects, including living beings (for instance, you might have trouble telling two people of the same size apart). Roll at -4 to distinguish objects of similar size and shape. The GM may also require a Vision-4 roll to read by reflected heat. Sudden flashes of heat (e.g., a flare, fiery explosion, or infrared laser) can blind you, just as a flash of light can blind ordinary vision.<br>
Cost depends on your capabilities:<br>
You can only see using Infravision, and are subject to its limitations at all times: 0 points.<br>
You can switch freely between normal vision and Infravision: 10 points.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>INJURY TOLERANCE</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>Variable</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You have fewer physiological weaknesses than ordinary living beings. The cost of this advantage depends on the precise frailties eliminated. Note that some forms of Injury Tolerance include others, and that Diffuse, Homogenous, and Unliving are mutually incompatible.<br>
Diffuse: Your body is fluid or particulate, composed of a swarm of smaller entities, or perhaps made of pure energy. This makes you immune to crippling injuries and reduces the damage you suffer from most physical blows; see Injury to Unliving, Homogenous, and Diffuse Targets (p. 380). Most foes (GM's decision) cannot slam or grapple you! Diffuse includes all the benefits of No Blood, No Brain, and No Vitals. 100 points.<br>
Homogenous: Your body has no vulnerable internal organs, bones, muscles, or other mechanisms. As a result, you are less susceptible to piercing and impaling attacks; see Injury to Unliving, Homogenous, and Diffuse Targets (p. 380). Homogenous includes the benefits of No Brain and No Vitals. This trait is intended for entities such as iron golems, trees, and slimes. 40 points.<br>
No Blood: You do not rely upon a vital bodily fluid (like blood) for survival. You do not bleed (see Bleeding, p. 420), are unaffected by blood-borne toxins, and are immune to attacks that rely on cutting off blood to part of your body. 5 points.<br>
No Brain: Your brain - if you have one - is distributed throughout your body, or isn't your true seat of consciousness. Your opponents cannot target it for extra damage. You may have a head, but a blow to the skull or eye is treated no differently than a blow to the face (except that an eye injury can still cripple that eye). 5 points.<br>
No Eyes: You lack eyes or other vulnerable optics, but can somehow see despite this (unless of course you suffer from Blindness, p. 124). As you have no eyes, they cannot be attacked. You are also immune to blinding attacks. 5 points.<br>
No Head: You have no head at all. This includes the benefits of No Brain. As well, you lack skull and face hit locations, and have no need for head armor. You can still see, speak, hear, smell, taste, etc. unless you take the appropriate disadvantages. Specify how you do this (supernaturally, technologically, via organs on your torso, etc.). It is common - but not mandatory - for those with No Head to have No Neck, No Eyes, or both. 7 points.<br>
No Neck: You have no neck. As a result, you have no neck hit location, and cannot be decapitated, choked, or strangled. 5 points.<br>
No Vitals: You have no vital organs (such as a heart or engine) that attackers can target for extra damage. Treat hits to the vitals or groin as torso hits. 5 points.<br>
Unliving: Your body is not composed of living flesh. You take reduced damage from piercing and impaling attacks, but are not quite as resilient as if you were Homogenous; see Injury to Unliving, Homogenous, and Diffuse Targets (p. 380). This trait is intended mainly for machines and corporeal undead. 20 points.<br>
Damage Reduction: You divide the injury you suffer by 2, 3, or 4 after subtracting DR from damage and applying wounding modifiers. Unmodified, this trait reduces all injury - but except in high-powered supers games, the GM should consider requiring the Limited modifier; see Limited Defenses (p. B46). It would be fair to restrict heroes to Common, Occasional, or even Rare classes, or to damage types directly related to their powers. 50 points for a divisor of 2, 75 points for 3, 100 points for 4.<br>
Independent Body Parts: See Independent Body Parts (p. 52) for this complex form of Injury Tolerance, intended for undead and fantasy monsters. 35 points.<br>
Unbreakable Bones: Your bones are nearly indestructible, or you have alternative structural support that's difficult to damage (e.g., internal force fields). Damage to limbs and extremities still causes injury, subject to the usual maximums, but the injury needed to cripple these body parts is twice normal; that is, the amount usually required to dismember. This represents damage to the covering, not the skeleton. Crippling is at worst lasting; you never suffer permanent crippling or dismemberment (see pp. B421-422). The GM may rule that injury that destroys your body (-10xHP) breaks your skeleton, but since you're dead, this is a special effect. If this protection extends to your vitals and brain, add No Vitals and No Brain: your vitals and brain are in their usual locations, but your indestructible skeleton encloses them and prevents severe injury effects. 10 points.<br>
Infiltration: For Diffuse only. Your body is a fluid that can flow through the tiniest of holes. In addition to the usual benefits of Diffuse, you can ooze through porous barriers and narrow cracks. You can't shapeshift, stretch abnormally, or sprout new body parts - just seep under doors, through screens, etc. +40%.<br>
Swarm: For Diffuse only. You're a coordinated swarm of tiny creatures. You can scatter by taking a Concentrate maneuver. Your outer perimeter travels at your best applicable Move; maximum radius is 1/2 mile (buy Area Effect to change this). While scattered, only area-effect, cone, and explosion attacks can injure you, and only in proportion to the area they blanket; e.g., an attack that covers 5% of your area does 5% normal damage. You can focus your senses on any point within your area; changing viewpoints requires a Ready maneuver. Otherwise, treat this state as Insubstantiality (p. 55). To resume your normal form, you must contract to your usual size (at your Move score) and then take a Concentrate maneuver. Swarm includes Infiltration. +80% if you can't affect the material world; +160% if you can.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>INNATE ATTACK</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>Variable</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You have a natural or built-in attack with which you can inflict physical damage (for nondamaging attacks, see Affliction, p. 35, and Binding, p. 40). Examples include a dragon's fiery breath, a robot's built-in blaster, and a god's ability to hurl lightning bolts.<br>
By default, this is a ranged attack with 1/2D 10, Max 100, Acc 3, RoF 1, Shots N/A, and Recoil 1, although you can apply modifiers to change these statistics (see pp. 101-116).<br>
An Innate Attack inflicts 1d damage per level. Its cost per level depends on the type of damage it inflicts:<br>
;Burning (burn): Your attack inflicts damage using flame, an energy beam, or localized electrical burns. It may ignite fires! 5 points/level.<br>
;Corrosion (cor): Your attack involves acid, disintegration, or something similar. For every 5 points of basic damage you inflict, reduce the target's DR by 1, in addition to regular damage. (Living beings heal natural DR at the same rate as HP.) 10 points/level.<br>
;Crushing (cr): Your attack inflicts damage through blunt impact, like a bludgeoning weapon or an explosive blast. It is likely to cause knockback (p. 378), and is more effective at inflicting blunt trauma (p. 379) than other types of damage. 5 points/level.<br>
;Cutting (cut): Your attack inflicts lacerations, like those caused by an axe or broken glass. Multiply penetrating damage by 1.5. Cutting attacks can inflict blunt trauma and cause knockback. 7 points/level.<br>
;Fatigue (fat): Your attack is nonlethal. It might involve a low-amperage electric shock or a mind blast, or even inflict a weakening effect such as hypothermia or starvation. It reduces FP, not HP, and cannot affect machines. 10 points/level.<br>
;Impaling (imp): Your attack inflicts stab wounds, like a spear or an arrow. Double penetrating damage in flesh! Impaling attacks can target the eyes and vital organs, can inflict blunt trauma, and may slip through high-tech flexible armor. 8 points/level.<br>
;Piercing: Your attack involves a fast, blunt projectile, such as a bullet, or is sharp but too small to qualify as impaling, like a dart or a stinger. It may inflict blunt trauma, and can target the eyes and vital organs. There are four subclasses of piercing attack:<br>
Small Piercing (pi-): Use this for very low-energy projectiles (e.g., blowgun darts), or for attacks that tend to punch through the target and leave a small wound channel (e.g., armorpiercing bullets). Against flesh, halve damage that penetrates DR. 3 points/level.<br>
Piercing (pi): Use this for most rifle and pistol bullets. 5 points/level.<br>
Large Piercing (pi+): Use this for attacks similar to large-caliber solid bullets, or for smaller projectiles that create large wound channels (e.g., hollow- point bullets). Multiply penetrating damage in flesh by 1.5. 6 points/level.<br>
Huge Piercing (pi++): Use this for attacks that leave an even larger wound channel than large piercing. Double penetrating damage in flesh! 8 points/level.<br>
;Toxic (tox): Your attack inflicts cellular damage, in the manner of disease, poison, or radiation. It cannot normally affect machines. The modifiers Cyclic (p. 103), Onset (p. 113), and Resistible (p. 115) are usual, but not required. 4 points/level.<br>
;Partial Dice: You do not have to buy wholenumbered dice of damage. Each ±1 to damage counts as ±0.3 dice. Round the final cost up. For instance, an Innate Attack that does 1d+2 damage counts as 1.6 dice. If it were crushing (5 points/die), it would cost 1.6 x 5  8 points.<br>
Some attacks do only 1 point of damage. This counts as 0.25 dice. Once again, round cost up. Such attacks can still be deadly - especially if they involve the Follow-Up (p. 105) or Cyclic (p. 103) enhancement!<br>
<hr>
Special Modifiers<br>
Many special modifiers for Innate Attack appear under Attack Enhancements and Limitations (p. 102). You can use these to create almost any attack - built-in guns, lasers, jets of liquid fire, gale-force winds, etc. - and to duplicate the capabilities of weapons listed in GURPS books.<br>
Fatigue and toxic attacks intended to simulate poison or disease require modifiers. Noxious agents on Claws (p. 42), Teeth (p. 91), darts, etc. use Follow-Up (p. 105). Gases and sprays use Respiratory Agent (p. 108) or Contact Agent (p. 103), often with Area Effect (p. 102), Cone (p. 103), or Jet (p. 106). Attacks that depend on touch or on skin contact use Blood Agent (p. 102) or Contact Agent, plus one of Aura (p. 102) or Melee Attack (p. 112).<br>
Regardless of other modifiers, Innate Attacks are treated as ranged attacks unless given the Melee Attack limitation; then they're considered melee weapons.<br>
<hr>
Description<br>
After applying all relevant modifiers, name and describe the attack. You can be as general as dragon fire or as specific as 9mm machine pistol cybernetically implanted in right arm. At the GM's discretion, the description can imply additional noncombat abilities; for instance, a jet of high-pressure water could put out fires. The GM has the final say as to whether your description fits the campaign setting, and may modify the attack if necessary.<br>
If an ability causes injury and isn't a natural melee weapon (like claws), it's an Innate Attack. Given the variety of attacks possessed by powered heroes in comics, movies, and so on, this covers a lot of ground. The first step when designing any Innate Attack is to choose its damage type:<br>
Burning: Use this for electricity, flame, heat, and radiation. Examples include fireballs, lasers, lightning bolts, microwaves, and particle beams. Enhance the attack with Explosion (+50%/level) for a fireball, Radiation (+100%) for a particle beam, or Surge (+20%) for lightning. Exotic attacks might require combinations of damage modifiers: Radiation and Surge for charged particle beams, Explosion and Surge for ball lightning, Surge and No Wounding (-50%) for an electromagnetic pulse (EMP) that only harms electrical systems, etc.<br>
Corrosion: Realistic examples are strong acids and bases. Powerful oxidizers also qualify, and tend to be Incendiary (+10%). Magical, superpowered, and superscience disintegration effects fall into this category, too.<br>
Crushing: This is most appropriate for attacks that hurl large, blunt chunks of matter, like balls of stone or ice (but not bullets - those are piercing). Superscience force beams qualify as well. Explosives are crushing attacks with both Explosion (+50%/level) and Fragmentation (+15%/die); timed explosives, such as grenades, add Delay (variable).<br>
Cutting: Cutting attacks nearly always involve blades or shards, which might be made of bone, glass, ice, metal, or any number of other things. Tiny shards that damage mainly as a result of their sharpness have No Blunt Trauma (-20%) and No Knockback (-10%). Cutting attacks are often carriers for venomous Follow- Up attacks.<br>
Fatigue: Tranquilizers are the obvious real-world example, and have Cyclic, Onset, and Resistible (all highly variable). At higher TLs, sonic and electrical stunners become possibilities. Supernatural options include sleep spells and psionic mind blasts. Fatigue is the only damage type that can have Hazard enhancements (see p. B104). It can't harm inanimate objects, but with Hazard, the GM may let it affect them - Freezing could cool off a cheeseburger, Suffocation might deprive an engine of air, and so on.<br>
Impaling: The notes for cutting damage apply here as well, but No Knockback isn't allowed - impaling attacks don't cause knockback in the first place.<br>
Piercing: The most common example is a bullet or bullet-sized projectile. See below for detailed notes on projectiles; see Guns as Innate Attacks (box) to simulate firearms.<br>
Toxic: Realistic poisons and diseases have Cyclic, Onset, and Resistible (all variable) - but supernatural death touches, evil eyes, etc. also qualify as toxic, and often lack these modifiers. A direct, physical attack that delivers a rad dosage instead of injury has Radiation (+25%).<br>
Next, define how the attack delivers its damage:<br>
Beam: Supers and energy weapons frequently project damaging rays. Most are burning, and don't absolutely require modifiers - but lasers have Armor Divisor (2) (+50%) and blasters have Armor Divisor (5) (+150%). Disintegration beams cause corrosion damage, often with Armor Divisor (10) (+200%) or Cosmic (+300%). Force beams are crushing, typically with Double Knockback (+20%); most other crushing beams have No Knockback (-10%). Stun beams inflict fatigue damage. Only death rays (supernatural or superscience) are likely to deliver toxic damage. Roll against Innate Attack (Beam) to hit with any kind of beam.<br>
Curse or Mental Blast: Damaging supernatural effects that bypass DR might do any kind of damage. Use burning for pyrokinetic attacks; fatigue for nonlethal attacks, with Freezing (+20%) for cryokinesis, Missed Sleep (+50%) for a sleep spell, and so on; or toxic for a death spell or telekinetic attack. Add Malediction 1 (+100%) for spells or Malediction 2 (+150%) for psionic abilities. See Affliction (p. 39) for additional notes. Since there's no physical impact, add No Knockback (-10%) if damage is crushing or cutting. Malediction uses a Will roll, not a standard attack roll.<br>
Field: Most constant, injurious effects that surround the user - sheath of flame, radiation zone, aura of withering, etc. - are burning or toxic, with Aura (+80%), Always On (-40%), and Melee Attack (-30%). Those who attack by emitting an expanding ring of fire, ice, poison, etc. from their body have Area Effect (+50%/level) and Emanation (-20%) instead, with damage type depending on the substance or energy involved. Neither requires a roll to hit - but to use an Aura actively calls for an unarmed melee attack.<br>
Gas: Lethal gases inflict toxic damage; nonlethal ones, fatigue damage. Fictional breath weapons have Cone (variable), but supers and wizards who can create gas clouds should take Area Effect (+50%/level) instead. Add one of Respiratory Agent (+50%), Blood Agent (+100%), or Contact Agent (+150%) to any gas attack. Drifting (+20%) and Persistent (+40%) are useful for lingering gases - and the GM might even allow these with Cone. Use Innate Attack (Breath) to hit with a Cone. Area Effects that depend on a beam, gaze, or projectile use the appropriate Innate Attack specialty to hit.<br>
Liquid: Liquids have Cone (variable) or Jet (+0%); fantasy breath weapons with Cone should have Reduced Range, x1/5 (-20%), too. Acids inflict corrosion damage, while flaming liquids cause burning damage; either might be Cyclic (variable), if it sticks to the target. Water jets are crushing - often with Double Knockback (+20%) and No Wounding (-50%). Poisons inflict either fatigue or toxic damage, and have one of Blood Agent (-40% for Jet, +100% for Cone), Contact Agent (-30% for Jet, +150% for Cone), or Respiratory Agent (+50%). Roll against Innate Attack (Beam) or (Breath) to hit with liquids that issue from the hand or mouth, respectively.<br>
Projectile: Projectiles don't require modifiers, but are among the few attacks that are routinely Guided (+50%), Homing (variable), or lobbed Overhead (+30%). They can deliver almost any kind of damage: burning for fireballs, crushing for stones, impaling for ice spears, and so on. Storms of fire, stones, ice, etc. are common magical and super attacks, and have Area Effect (+50%/level) - with Persistent (+40%) and possibly Wall (+30% or +60%) if they stay in place for some time, and often Bombardment (variable). To emulate firearms, see Guns as Innate Attacks (p. 54). Use Innate Attack (Projectile) to hit.<br>
Touch: Most natural body weaponry is just Claws, Strikers, or Teeth - but a melee attack that operates independently of the user's ST is an Innate Attack with the Melee Attack limitation (variable). Use this option for an angel who can summon a sword of flame (burning), a robot with a builtin force sword (cutting), or a kung fu master who attacks with a deadly touch (toxic). Add Contact Agent (-30%) to attacks that must strike bare skin, Cosmic (+300%) to supernatural attacks that completely circumvent DR, like the Deathtouch spell (p. B245). Make an unarmed melee attack to hit.<br>
Venom: Poison on Claws, Teeth, etc. should cause fatigue or toxic damage unless it's very unusual. Such attacks always have Follow-Up (+0%). Make a melee attack to hit with the carrier attack. Finally, if the attack has a chance of causing a baneful effect in addition to injury if it penetrates DR, add Side Effect (variable). This is common for beams that emulate ultra-tech stunners, paralysis guns, and so on. If the attack automatically causes weakness or incapacity after inflicting enough injury, enhance it with Symptoms (variable) instead. Fatigue or toxic attacks that represent venom or poison gas generally have Symptoms.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>INSUBSTANTIALITY</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>80 points</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You can become intangible, passing through solid objects as though they weren't there. In this state, gravity does not affect you - you can move in any direction at full Move (and make no noise when you move). You can perceive the tangible world, and speak normally to those within it, but you cannot pick up normal objects or affect them in any way.<br>
Physical and energy attacks cannot harm you, but you're still vulnerable to psionic and (nonmaterial) magical attacks. Likewise, your physical and energy attacks cannot affect physical opponents. Your psi abilities and magic spells can affect the physical world, but at -3 to all skill rolls.<br>
Although you can pass through solids, you must still breathe. When moving through a solid object, treat this as if you were swimming underwater for purposes of suffocation. You cannot materialize inside a solid object.<br>
Your natural form (physical or insubstantial) is considered a special effect. You must take this advantage if you can change between a physical and an insubstantial form.<br>
This trait can represent any number of abilities from folklore and fiction. You should work out its origins (see p. 33) and special effects with the GM - perhaps you vibrate out of synch with reality, phase into a different dimension, or become a spirit. This determines your appearance, which may be transparent, misty . . . or completely normal (but you can't be invisible without the Invisibility advantage). Your physical and energy attacks affect other beings using the same form of Insubstantiality, and their attacks affect you. The GM may rule that certain materials, energy barriers, magic spells, etc. are impenetrable to your particular form of Insubstantiality.<br>
Dimensional: The traveler transports himself into a dimension parallel to the physical world. He looks slightly transparent, as if he weren't all there. Any place in the ordinary world that lacks an equivalent location in the other plane is completely off limits. Individuals with dimension-traveling foes often build strongholds in such locales!<br>
Divine: This represents the ability to assume a god form that can roam the mortal world at will. The cleric looks normal except for the addition of something symbolic of his patron; e.g., a wreath of flame, for the Fire God. He can't infiltrate places of no or low sanctity, however; see Special Rules for Divine Powers (p. 175).<br>
Elemental: The user turns into electricity or light, or vibrates at a weird frequency. He becomes a man-shaped glow, visible shimmering, etc., as befits his element. He can't penetrate barriers that are proof against his element; e.g., a grounded metal cage would exclude an electrical ghost. Superscience force fields often block such Insubstantiality.<br>
Magical, Psionic, or Spirit: The user enters the ethereal, astral, or spirit realm (these might be the same or quite distinct, depending on the setting). His appearance is misty and ghostly, and possibly luminous or shadowy. Shamans with spirit powers often look like beasts. Spells, psi abilities, and sorcerous rituals that obstruct spirits also block this ability.<br>
<hr>
</p><h3 class="card">Special Enhancements</h3><p class="card">
Affect Substantial: If you have any abilities that can affect the substantial world when you are insubstantial - including magic, psionics, or powers with the Affects Substantial enhancement (p. 102) - this advantage costs more. +100%.<br>
Can Carry Objects: Normally, you cannot carry anything while insubstantial. This enhancement lets you carry objects, including clothing and armor. They become physical if dropped. You cannot materialize these objects inside other objects or characters. No encumbrance is +10%; Light, +20%; Medium, +50%; Heavy, +100%.<br>
Partial Change: You can turn part of your body substantial while other parts remain insubstantial, or vice versa. Thus, you could reach through a wall and tap someone on the shoulder. If you also have Can Carry Objects, you can materialize your hand, pick up material objects, and carry them while insubstantial. +20%, or +100% if you can turn an item you are carrying substantial without dropping it (this requires turning your hand substantial, too).<br>
<hr>
</p><h3 class="card">Special Limitations</h3><p class="card">
Always On: You are always insubstantial and cannot materialize. If you have this limitation, there is no -3 to use magic or psionics. -50%.<br>
Usually On: Similar to Always On, but you can materialize for short periods with great effort. Materialization costs 1 FP per second. -40%.<br>
No Vertical Move: You can't disregard gravity. You must move across a horizontal surface, or along a slope that wouldn't require Climbing rolls. You still weigh nothing, so you don't leave footprints and can walk on surfaces that wouldn't support a solid body, such as the surface of a body of water. -10%.<br>
Noisy: You aren't silent. You make noises equivalent to footfalls when moving and breathing at all times, and are no harder to hear than an ordinary human. -5%.<br>
Projection: Your body doesn't become insubstantial. Instead, it falls unconscious and you step out of it in insubstantial form. Like someone using unmodified Insubstantiality, you're visible and present, making you subject to anything that affects insubstantial entities . . . while your body remains in the physical world, vulnerable to material threats; see Projection (p. 44). You can't use spells, psi abilities, etc. in this form unless you also take Affect Substantial. -50%.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>INTUITION</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>15 points</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You usually guess right. When faced with a number of alternatives, and no logical way to choose among them, you can ask the GM to let you use your Intuition. The GM makes a secret IQ roll, with a bonus equal to the number of good choices and a penalty equal to the number of bad choices. On a success, he steers you to a good choice; on a critical success, he tells you the best choice. On a failure, he gives you no information; on a critical failure, he steers you toward a bad choice. The GM can modify this as he sees fit for other situations where Intuition might logically help. Only one roll per question is allowed.<br>
The GM should never allow Intuition to short-circuit an adventure - for instance, by letting the intuitive detective walk into a room, slap the cuffs on the guilty party, and close the case. At the most, Intuition would point the detective in the direction of a good clue. GMs who don't think they can control Intuition should not allow it in their games.<br>
Inspired: Your gift is so finely honed that any success while using it reveals the best choice out of those confronting you. The worst possible result on a failure, even a critical failure, is that you don't know; the GM will never suggest a bad choice. +100%.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>INVISIBILITY</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>40 points</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You are invisible. Unlike most advantages, this one is always on unless you take a special enhancement. You still make noise, leave footprints, and have a scent - and by default, anything you carry remains visible. If you are carrying nothing, you get a +9 to Stealth in any situation where being seen would matter.<br>
Individuals using paranormal remote viewing (crystal balls, Clairvoyance, etc.) cannot see you if you would be invisible to their normal vision. Devices with these powers can still sense you, as can paranormal abilities that detect enemies, life, and so on nonvisually.<br>
Invisibility only works against one sort of vision. Types include electromagnetic vision (which encompasses ordinary vision, Infravision, Ultravision, and radar), sonar, magnetic fields, and anything else the GM comes up with. If you are invisible to electromagnetic vision, you do not cast a shadow and don't show up in mirrors.<br>
Deception: A ninja or telepath who mentally compels others to believe they can't see him has Invisibility to electromagnetic vision with Can Carry Objects, Switchable, and Glamour (p. 111). Deceivers aware of unusual senses might interfere with those, too; add Extended (+20%/type).<br>
Ghost: Ghosts that are invisible to mortals have Invisibility to electromagnetic vision with Usually On (+5%) and Substantial Only (-10%). Traditionally, ghosts can be seen in mirrors and photographs; they have Visible Reflection (-10%), and can't take Affects Machines.<br>
Stealth Technology: A vehicle or robot that's invisible to infrared and radar - but not the naked eye - has Invisibility to electromagnetic vision with Machines Only (-50%). The best optical camouflage has Affects Machines (+50%) instead of Machines Only, but still suffers from Fringe (-10%). Stealthy submarines have unmodified Invisibility to sonar; the best add Extended, Magnetic Detection (+20%). Switchable is uncommon, as stealth tends to be a permanent structural feature.<br>
Superscience Cloaking: Spaceopera cloaking devices give Invisibility to electromagnetic vision with Affects Machines (+50%), Extended, Scanners (+20%), and Switchable (+10%).<br>
<hr>
</p><h3 class="card">Special Enhancements</h3><p class="card">
Affects Machines: You are invisible even to machines. You cannot be photographed, and you don't show up on cameras or other detectors. Devices such as pressure plates still notice you, but you could walk past a robot sentry undetected. Electronically targeted weapons get no bonuses to hit you. +50%.<br>
Can Carry Objects: The objects you carry, including clothing and armor, become invisible. They regain visibility when put down. No encumbrance is +10%; Light, +20%; Medium, +50%; Heavy, +100%.<br>
Extended: You are invisible to more than one type of vision (for instance, electromagnetic vision and magnetic fields). +20% per additional type of vision.<br>
Switchable: You are normally visible, but can become invisible at will. +10%.<br>
Usually On: You are normally invisible, but can become visible for short periods with great effort. Turning visible costs 1 FP per second. +5%.<br>
Fringe: Your ability leaves a faint outline or shimmering. It works normally when you're standing still, but if you move, others can spot you with a Vision-6 roll and target you in combat at only -6 to hit. -10%.<br>
<hr>
</p><h3 class="card">Special Limitations</h3><p class="card">
Machines Only: Similar to Affects Machines, but you are only invisible to machines. Living beings can see you normally. -50%.<br>

<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>JUMPER</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>100 points</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You can travel through time or to parallel worlds (sometimes known as timelines) merely by willing the jump. Decide whether you are a time-jumper or a world-jumper. To do both, you must buy Jumper (Time) and Jumper (World) separately, at full cost.<br>
To initiate a jump, you must visualize your destination, concentrate for 10 seconds, and make an IQ roll. You may hurry the jump, but your roll will be at -1 per second of concentration omitted (-10 to jump with no preparation at all). Regardless of IQ, a roll of 14 or more always fails. On a success, you appear at your target destination. On a failure, you go nowhere. On a critical failure, you arrive at the wrong destination, which can be any time or world the GM wishes!<br>
You appear at your destination at exactly the same place you left your previous time or world - or as close as possible. When jumping through time, this means the same place at a different time. When jumping between worlds, this means the same place at the same time, but on a parallel world.<br>
If there is no corresponding safe location within 100 yards of your destination - for instance, if you jump while on an airplane to a destination with no plane at your location, or from a half-mile deep mine to a destination with no corresponding mine - the jump will fail and you will know why it failed. This does not prevent you from jumping into other types of danger, such as radiation, gunfire, or wild animals. If you have Danger Sense, the GM should roll before you make a hazardous jump; on a success, you get a warning.<br>
This ability always costs at least 1 FP to use, whether it succeeds or fails. Particularly distant times or worlds might cost more, perhaps up to 10 FP, at the GM's discretion. If you are a machine, this ability does not cost you FP - but if you have passengers, each of them must pay the FP cost.<br>
For an example of how Jumper might work in a particular game world, see World-Jumpers (p. 544).<br>
<hr>
Carrying Things<br>
You can carry up to Basic Lift when you travel, plus any Payload (see p. 74). Take the Extra Carrying Capacity enhancement (below) if you wish to carry more weight, or bring along other people.<br>
However, if multiple Jumpers of the same kind are in physical contact, when one jumps, the others can hitch a ride if they wish - even if the Jumper who initiates the jump does not want company. Only the person initiating the jump makes a die roll; wherever he ends up, the others do, too.<br>
If you are a world-jumper, hitching a ride is the only way to visit a new parallel world (save for a critical failure!). However, once you reach a world, you can memorize its feel by concentrating and spending character points to learn that world as an IQ/Easy skill. This takes one hour per point you wish to spend. Use this skill in place of IQ when you travel to that world in the future. You never have to memorize a world, but if you do not, you roll at IQ-3 to attempt to return.<br>
Time-jumpers have no similar restriction.<br>
You can improve this ability with practice, spending points to add enhancements or remove limitations. GMs who do not want the PCs jumping multiple times per adventure are free to impose mandatory limitations (e.g., Limited Use) that cannot be bought off.<br>
Jumper (Spirit): You can enter and leave the spirit worlds in body. In these realms, you're a spirit. You can interact normally with the spirits there and use any ability that's standard for spirits in that world. Likewise, anything that affects spirits affects you. To make the transition, use the standard rules for Jumper. Each attempt costs 1 FP. Success on the IQ roll means you shift between realms. Failure means you stay in your current world; you're at -5 to use this ability again in the next 10 minutes. Critical failure results are up to the GM . . . you might attract evil spirits, end up adrift between worlds, or go to the wrong world (e.g., Hell). The special modifiers for Jumper (World) are available to you, although not all of them are meaningful in every setting. 100 points.<br>
<hr>
</p><h3 class="card">Special Enhancements</h3><p class="card">
Extra Carrying Capacity: You can carry more than your Basic Lift. If your carrying capacity is high enough, you may transport one person with you. Light encumbrance is +10%; Medium, +20%; Heavy, +30%; Extra- Heavy, +50%.<br>
New Worlds: This is only available for world-jumpers. You can deliberately aim for worlds you haven't visited. The IQ roll is always at -3 or worse (GM's decision). Of course, it is always possible that the desired destination does not exist, in which case the attempt automatically fails - although the GM will not tell you why. All FP costs are doubled when using this enhancement. +50%.<br>
Omni-Jump: This is only available if you are both a world-jumper and a time-jumper! You must apply it to both Jumper advantages. This lets you move between times and timelines on a single IQ roll - for instance, from the present day in our timeline to 1066 A.D. in a parallel timeline where the Norman invasion of England failed. +10%.<br>
Tracking: You can travel to the home time or world of any manmade artifact you can hold or touch. Time-jumpers will arrive shortly after the item was created; world-jumpers will arrive at the current date on the item's home timeline. Any such attempt is at IQ-2, and each Jumper only gets one try per artifact. +20%.<br>
Tunnel: You always create a portal (of about your size) when you jump. Others may pass through it, even if they can't jump. The portal lingers for 3d seconds, which can be good or bad - it means enemies can follow you! +40%.<br>
Warp Jump: This enhancement is only available if you have the Warp advantage (p. 97). You must apply it to both Jumper and Warp. When you jump, you can simultaneously use Warp to appear anywhere at your destination. Two die rolls are necessary - one per ability - and it is possible for one to succeed while the other fails, or for both to fail. +10%.<br>
Interplanar: For Jumper (World) or (Spirit). You can enter higher planes of existence - perhaps even the realms of the gods. +100% if you can reach these worlds as well as parallel worlds (world-jumpers) or spirit worlds (spirit- jumpers); +0% if you can only reach higher planes.<br>
Reliable: Your ability is unusually stable. Each level of this enhancement adds +1 to both the IQ roll to use Jumper and the automatic failure threshold (e.g., Reliable 2 gives +2 to IQ and mean a roll of 16 or more always fails). +5% per +1, to a maximum of +10.<br>
<hr>
</p><h3 class="card">Special Limitations</h3><p class="card">
Cannot Escort: This is only available for world-jumpers. Other Jumpers cannot hitch a ride, even if you want to bring them along. -10%.<br>
Cannot Follow: This is only available for world-jumpers. You cannot hitch a ride with another Jumper. -20%.<br>
Drift: You do not arrive in exactly the location you left from. You won't arrive in thin air or underground, but you may show up anywhere within 10 miles of your planned destination. The better your IQ roll when you jump, the closer you will be to where you wanted to arrive, but it's the GM's call as to exactly where you appear. -15%.<br>
Limited Jump: You can only travel a certain distance through time, or a certain number of removes between parallel worlds, per jump. To go further, you must make multiple hops. The GM must set the value of this limitation for his campaign; it will be more of a handicap in some settings than in others. A suggested value is -10%.<br>
Maximum Range: You can only jump a certain total distance through time, or a certain number of removes between parallel worlds, no matter how many hops you make. Like Limited Jump, the GM must set the value of this limitation.<br>
Naked: You can carry nothing when you jump! You always arrive naked. -30%.<br>
Stunning: You are always mentally stunned after a jump. -10%.<br>
Limited Access: For Jumper (World) or (Spirit). You can only jump between two particular worlds - your home world and one specific parallel, the material world and Hell, etc. The size of this limitation depends on how many worlds exist in the setting. If there's only one, it's meaningless: -0%. If there are many, it might be worth -20% or more, at the GM's discretion.<br>
Projection: For Jumper (Time) or (World). You travel in mind, not in body. Your body remains at your departure point, unconscious and vulnerable, while your consciousness appears at your destination as a visible but intangible projection. This form is subject to anything that affects insubstantial beings. See Projection (p. 44) for other rules. If you have Insubstantiality, you can reverse it in order to become solid; if you have Possession (Spiritual, -20%), you can possess a resident of the target world. -50% if you can't affect your destination at all without Insubstantiality or Possession; -0% if you can use spells, mental abilities, and Maledictions to affect your destination while projecting. Sending a physical body to your destination as usual, but also leaving behind an unconscious body as described here, is worth -25%.<br>
Special Movement: You need to move to use your ability. Limitation value depends on how stringent the requirements are. If you merely have to walk a few steps and be free of anything that restricts movement (like manacles), that's -10%. If you need to enter orbit and accelerate past the speed of light with expensive advantages like Flight (Space Flight, +50%) with Enhanced Move 27 (Space), that's -40%.<br>
Special Portal: You need a particular sort of gateway to use your advantage; e.g., a natural cave opening, or a sacred stone circle on a moonlit night. Limitation value depends on the rarity of the required portal. Any reflective surface is -20%, as is a relatively common geographic feature. If a summoning ritual that specifically names you creates a channel that lets you jump into the presence of your summoner - but nowhere else - that's -60%. One specific spot at a certain time of the year is -80%.</p,></div></div>

<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>LEGAL ENFORCEMENT POWERS</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>5, 10, or 15 points</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You are a law enforcer, with the accompanying powers and restrictions. In some times and places, this amounts to a license to kill. In others, it's little more than the right to carry a badge and write parking tickets.<br>
The point cost depends on the kinds of laws you enforce, the size of your jurisdiction, how answerable you are for your actions, and the degree of respect you must show for the civil rights of others:<br>
* You have local jurisdiction, the ability to arrest suspected criminals, the power to perform searches with an appropriate warrant, and possibly the right to carry a concealed weapon. Examples: a Victorian bobby or a modern policeman. 5 points.<br>
* As above, but you also have national or international jurisdiction, or are not obligated to respect the civil rights of others, or are free to engage in covert investigations, or may kill with relative impunity. Examples: an FBI agent or a medieval Royal Guardsman. 10 points.<br>
* You have three or more of the above abilities. Examples: a Gestapo, KGB, or Stasi agent. 15 points.<br>
Legal Enforcement Powers almost always require an appropriate Duty (p. 133). In some cases, a Reputation (positive, negative, or mixed) is also appropriate. All levels of Legal Enforcement Powers include Police Rank 0 (see p. 30). To become a senior law enforcer, buy more Rank.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>LEGAL IMMUNITY</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>5 to 20 points</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You are exempt from some or all of the laws of your society. Should you break the law, ordinary law enforcers do not have the power to charge you. Only one particular authority - your own church or social class, a special court, perhaps even your ruler - can judge or punish you. The point cost depends on how sweeping the immunity is (GM's judgment):<br>
* You are not subject to ordinary laws, but the rules that govern your behavior are just as strict. Examples: a medieval abbot or a modern UN observer. 5 points.<br>
* As above, but the laws that apply to you are less strict than those that apply to most people. Example: a medieval bard (see below). 10 points.<br>
* You can do nearly anything you please provided you don't injure the nation, church, or other power that granted you Legal Immunity in the first place. Examples: a medieval duke or an international diplomat (see below). 15 points.<br>
For an extra 5 points, you may add diplomatic pouch privileges: you can send and receive mail or objects that the ordinary authorities cannot legally stop or examine.<br>
Two classes of Legal Immunity are of special interest to adventurers:<br>
Bardic Immunity: You have the right to sing what you please without fear of serious consequences. You may even sing a grossly insulting song to the king - you might get banished for it, but you can't be whipped, imprisoned, or killed. Anyone who violates your immunity risks damage to his name and reputation. Other bards will compose and distribute vicious satires about him, giving him a bad Reputation. They might even expose a Secret, if he has one! This advantage applies to the content of your performances and nothing else. It is only available to true bards, in fantasy/ medieval settings. To qualify for this advantage, you must spend at least 1 point apiece on the Performance, Poetry, and Singing skills. 10 points.<br>
Diplomatic Immunity: You are an international diplomat. You may ignore the laws of all countries except your own. While abroad, you cannot be prosecuted for any crime, no matter how grave; the local police may arrest you, but they cannot press charges. The only recourse for a foreign government is to declare you persona non grata. This means you must leave the country at once, ending your current assignment - and possibly your career. Foreign powers may request your extradition for normal prosecution, but your government is unlikely to comply. This trait always comes with a Duty (p. 133) to a government agency, and often has some level of Administrative Rank (p. 30) as a prerequisite. 20 points.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>LESS SLEEP</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>2 points/level</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You need less sleep than most people. A normal human requires 8 hours of sleep per night. Each level of this advantage - to a maximum of four levels - lets you get by with one hour less than this, giving you a few extra hours each day in which to study or work on other projects.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>LIFTING ST</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>3 points per +1 ST</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You have lifting capacity out of proportion to your mass. This is common for vehicles and supers. Add your Lifting ST to your ordinary ST when you determine Basic Lift (p. 15) for the purposes of carrying, lifting, pushing, and pulling. Lifting ST also adds to ST in situations where you can apply slow, steady pressure (grappling, choking, etc.). Lifting ST does not boost ST (or Basic Lift) for the purpose of determining HP, throwing distance, or damage inflicted by melee attacks or thrown weapons.<br>
If you bought your ST with the Size limitation, apply the same limitation to Lifting ST. The No Fine Manipulators limitation does not give a discount, however.<br>
Super-Effort: You can make truly heroic lifts! Your Lifting ST works as usual except when you use extra effort. Then ignore the ordinary extra effort rules. Instead, find your Lifting ST level in the Size column of the Size and Speed/Range Table (p. B550), read across to the Linear Measurement column, and use that number as your ST bonus for the lift. For instance, Lifting ST +20 gives +5,000 ST. This costs 1 FP per lift. Once you've made the lift, use Abilities and Exertion (p. 159) for ongoing FP costs. Walking around with or pulling the weight counts as intensive use (1 FP/minute); just holding it up is long-term use (1 FP/hour). You can't take Reduced Fatigue Cost to eliminate these costs unless you also add Cosmic (+50%). Super-Effort never benefits chokes or grapples. +400%.</p,></div></div>

Lightning Calculator: You, the player, may use a calculator at any time, to figure anything you want - even if your character is fleeing for his life! For simple math problems, the GM may just say that your character knows the answer. 2 points.<br>
Intuitive Mathematician: As above, but your ability is not limited to arithmetic. You can perform astrogation without a computer, do any level of engineering design in your head, and solve differential equations almost instantaneously. You never need a calculator; you yourself are far faster than that, and even faster than many computers. 5 points.<br>

<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>LUCK</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>Variable</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You were born lucky! There are three progressively more cinematic levels of Luck:<br>
Luck: Once per hour of play, you may reroll a single bad die roll twice and take the best of the three rolls! You must declare that you are using your Luck immediately after you roll the dice. Once you or anyone else has made another die roll, it is too late to use Luck. If the GM is rolling in secret (e.g., to see if you notice something), you may tell him you are using your Luck ahead of time, and he must roll three times and give you the best result. 15 points.<br>
Extraordinary Luck: As above, but usable every 30 minutes. 30 points.<br>
Ridiculous Luck: As above, but usable every 10 minutes! 60 points.<br>
Your Luck only applies to your own success, damage, or reaction rolls, or on outside events that affect you or your whole party, or when you are being attacked (in which case you may make the attacker roll three times and take the worst roll!).<br>
You cannot share Luck. If Strong Sam is trying to kick open a door, Lucky Lou can't stand behind him and transfer his Luck. He'll have to kick that door himself.<br>
Once you use Luck, you must wait an hour of real time (30 minutes for Extraordinary Luck, 10 minutes for Ridiculous Luck) before using it again. You cannot use Luck at 11:58 and then again at 12:01. And you cannot save up Luck. You cannot play for hours without using Luck and then use it several times in a row!<br>
Wishing: You can consciously manipulate probability. You may request two rerolls for any die roll made in your presence - not just your rolls - and choose the one you prefer. It isn't enough for you, the player to see the dice roll; your character must witness the action you wish to influence. Normal usage limits still apply. The Active limitation is common but not required. +100%.<br>
Active: Your Luck is a conscious supernatural power. You must declare that you are using it before you roll the dice. It cannot be used after the fact to reroll a bad result. -40%.<br>
Aspected: Your Luck applies only to one specific class of related tasks, such as athletics, social interactions, or skills you use at your job. Combat is a valid choice, but it only affects weapon skill rolls, active defenses, and ST or DX rolls for close combat - not DX rolls to avoid tripping, HT rolls to survive, etc. -20%.<br>
Defensive: You can only use your Luck to reroll failed active defense rolls, resistance rolls, or HT rolls to resist the effects of injury, or to make an opponent reroll a critical hit against you. -20%.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>MAGERY</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>5 points for Magery 0, +10 points/level</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You are magically adept. This advantage comes in levels. You must purchase Magery 0 before buying higher levels of Magery.<br>
Magery 0: This is basic magical awareness, a prerequisite for learning magic in most worlds. The GM makes a Sense roll (p. 358) when you first see a magic item, and again when you first touch it. On a success, you intuitively know that the item is magical. A roll of 3 or 4 also tells you whether the magic is helpful or dangerous, and about how strong it is. Those without Magery do not get this roll! 5 points.<br>
Magery 1+: Higher levels of Magery make it much easier to learn and use magic. Add your Magery to IQ when you learn spells. For instance, if you have IQ 14, Magery 3 lets you learn spells as if you had IQ 17. Add your Magery level to Perception when you roll to sense magic items, and to IQ when you learn Thaumatology skill (p. 225).<br>
Reduce the time required to learn new spells in play (but not the point cost) by 10% per Magery level, to a minimum of 60% of the usual time at Magery 4. For instance, with Magery 3, you would learn spells in 70% the usual time.<br>
Powerful spells require a minimum level of Magery as a prerequisite, so be sure to skim the Spell List (pp. 242- 253) when deciding how much Magery you need. Note that high Magery lets you produce powerful results with even the most basic spells; see Magery and Effect (p. 237). The GM sets the maximum Magery allowed to PCs. Magery 3 is about right for classic fantasy. 10 points/level (on top of the 5 points for Magery 0).<br>
<hr>
Mages in Nonmagical Settings<br>
The use of Magery becomes tricky in nonmagical backgrounds. You still have the ability to sense magic, but until you gain experience with magic, the GM should not say, That idol is magical, but, That idol looks very strange to you, very sinister. You sense there is something special about it. If you are from a nonmagical culture, you do not start with any spells, but you can still learn magic if you find an opportunity. When you enter a magical world, those who can detect your aura recognize you as a potential magic-user. How they react depends on the setting.<br>
Magery 0 costs 5 points for all mages, but you may apply one of the limitations below to the 10 points/level for Magery 1+. Limited Magery is sometimes known as aspected Magery.<br>
<hr>
</p><h3 class="card">Special Limitations</h3><p class="card">
Dance: You must be free to use bodily motions in order to cast spells. You are not freed from rituals requiring movement as your spell level increases (see Magic Rituals, p. 237). However, you need not speak at all to cast your spells. -40%.<br>
Dark-Aspected: You can only use your powers in darkness. Regardless of the time of day or night, any light greater than candlelight or starlight deprives you of your abilities, though your aura reveals that you are a mage. -50%.<br>
Day-Aspected: You can use your powers only when the sun is in the sky - on average, from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. During solar eclipses, you have no powers! The effects of other astronomical events are up to the GM. When the sun is down, you have none of your magical abilities, although a look at your aura reveals that you are a mage. You are not affected by being in buildings, underground, and so on; only the sun's position matters. You know automatically (if you are awake) when it is one minute to sunrise and one minute to sunset. -40%.<br>
Musical: You must use a musical instrument in order to cast spells. You can never cast spells silently. -50%.<br>
Night-Aspected: You can only use your powers when the sun is not in the sky - on average, from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. When the sun is up, you have none of your magical abilities, although a look at your aura reveals that you are a mage. You are not affected by being in buildings, underground, and so on; only the sun's position matters. You know automatically (if you are awake) when it is one minute to sunrise and one minute to sunset. -40%.<br>
One College Only: Your Magery only benefits the spells of a single college and the Recover Energy spell (p. 248). You learn other spells as though you were a nonmage, and can only cast them in high-mana areas. You may still count such spells as prerequisites for spells in your own college. You cannot detect magic items unless they contain at least one spell of your college, in which case you roll normally for detection on first sight and first touch. -40%.<br>
Solitary: Your magical abilities are at -3 for every sapient being within five yards of you, and -6 for anyone touching you. As partial compensation, you get a roll vs. IQ to notice any time a sapient creature enters or leaves the five-yard area around you - but this only works on a single person. If there is already someone standing next to you, you won't notice if someone else approaches. -40%.<br>
Song: You must be able to sing in order to cast your spells. You are not freed from the ritual of speaking to cast spells as your spell level increases (see Magic Rituals, p. 237). -40%.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>MAGIC RESISTANCE</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>2 points/level</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You are less likely to be affected by magic. Subtract your Magic Resistance from the skill of anyone casting a spell on you, and add it to your roll to resist any spell that offers a resistance roll. For instance, if you have Magic Resistance 3, wizards have -3 to cast spells on you and you get +3 to resist. In addition, you may roll against HT + Magic Resistance to resist the effects of magical elixirs. You cannot turn off this advantage to let friendly wizards cast spells on you (e.g., to heal you) or to benefit from helpful elixirs!<br>
Magic Resistance only interferes with spells cast directly on you. It provides no benefit against Missile spells (which are cast on the wizard's hand and hurled at you), attacks by magic weapons, or informationgathering spells that aren't cast directly on you. It also has no effect on supernatural powers other than magic; e.g., divine miracles, psionics, or the innate powers of spirits.<br>
Magic Resistance, and its precise level, can be recognized by any mage who looks at your aura, or by anyone who casts a spell on you.<br>
You cannot combine Magic Resistance with Magery. If you have even one level of Magic Resistance, you can't cast spells at all (although you can still use magic weapons).<br>
<hr>
</p><h3 class="card">Special Enhancements</h3><p class="card">
Improved: You Magic Resistance does not interfere with your own ability to cast spells. This allows you to possess both Magery and Magic Resistance. +150%.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>MANA DAMPER</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>10 points/level</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You negate magical energy (mana) in your vicinity, making it difficult or impossible for others to cast spells. You can never cast spells yourself, nor can you have any level of Magery.<br>
Each level of Mana Damper (to a maximum of three) reduces the local mana level by one step, but only for you and people or things that you're carrying. For instance, a wizard could throw a fireball at you unhindered, but he would find it difficult to use magic to turn you to stone or read your mind. For details, see Mana (p. 235).<br>
<hr>
</p><h3 class="card">Special Enhancements</h3><p class="card">
Area Effect: Your ability affects everything in an area centered on you. The first level of Area Effect gives you a radius of one yard. Each level after the first doubles this radius as usual; see Area Effect (p. 102). +50%/level.<br>
Switchable: You can switch this power off - for instance, to let a friendly wizard affect you or operate within your area of effect. +100%.<br>
Discriminatory: You and any allies in your area of effect enjoy the best mana level your ability can provide - highest if casting spells, lowest if resisting them - while enemies in the area suffer the worst level you can generate. This modifier includes Switchable, and replaces the Selective Area enhancement for Mana Damper and Mana Enhancer. +150%.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>MANA ENHANCER</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>50 points/level</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You radiate magical energy, or mana. Each level of Mana Enhancer (to a maximum of two) increases the local mana level by one step, but only for you and people or things that you're carrying. If more than one character with Mana Enhancer could increase the mana level, apply only the highest increase; do not add the effects together.<br>
This ability does not directly confer the ability to cast spells; for that, take Magery (p. 66). However, if you can raise the mana level to high or better, you can cast many spells without Magery! For details, see Mana (p. 235).<br>
This ability has its drawbacks: you cannot have Magic Resistance, and mages get an IQ + Magery roll to sense that you possess this trait. In some game worlds, this combination may force you to hide from unethical wizards!<br>
The GM should keep this trait under strict control, as it is powerful and easily abused in fantasy settings.<br>

<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>MEDIUM</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>10 points</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You can perceive and communicate with spirits - particularly spirits of the dead. You don't see them visually, but you know when they're nearby. You can speak with any spirit in your presence, provided you share a language. You can also call spirits to you; there is no guarantee that they will answer your summons, but they will hear it. Note that this trait does not give you a reaction bonus with spirits, or any power to control their behavior.<br>
Manifestation: Your presence makes it easier for spirits to become visible, if they wish. As long as they're within a yard of you, those with the Spirit meta-trait (p. B263) needn't pay the 1 FP per second demanded by the Usually On limitation on their Invisibility. +100%.<br>
Universal: You can communicate with any spirit you can sense with Medium, even those with whom you don't share a language. +50%.<br>
Visual: You can see spirits while communicating with them, even if they would normally be invisible. +50%.<br>
Specialized: Your ability only works with one specific class of spirits. Possibilities include angels, demons, elementals, faerie creatures, and ghosts. -50%.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>METABOLISM CONTROL</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>5 points/level</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You can control normally involuntary biological functions such as pulse, blood flow, digestion, and respiration. Each level of Metabolism Control gives +1 on any HT roll that would benefit from such control (GM's decision), including bleeding rolls (see Bleeding, p. 420) and rolls to recover from (not resist) disease and poison.<br>
You can also enter a deathlike trance. Anyone unfamiliar with your metabolism must win a Quick Contest of Diagnosis vs. your HT + Metabolism Control to discover that you aren't dead. In this state, each level of Metabolism Control reduces by 10% the amount of oxygen you need to stay alive (at level 10 or higher, you don't breathe at all), and doubles the amount of time you can safely go without food or water. You are unaware of your surroundings while in your trance, but awaken automatically if injured. You may also set a mental alarm clock to awaken you after a certain amount of time has passed.<br>
This ability is incompatible with the Machine meta-trait (see p. 263).<br>
Mastery: You can make precise adjustments to your metabolism and body chemistry instantly, helping you cope with even extreme or unexpected stresses. As long as you're conscious, add your level of Metabolism Control to any HT roll. +40%.<br>
<hr>
</p><h3 class="card">Special Limitations</h3><p class="card">
Hibernation: You can only use the trance ability, and get no bonus to HT rolls. Furthermore, you automatically enter a trance when exposed to certain environmental conditions - great cold, drought, etc. Work this out with the GM. In such conditions, you must make a Will roll to avoid hibernation. You can induce hibernation voluntarily. To do so, roll vs. Will-4 hourly until you succeed. You cannot set a precise wake up time. Set a duration, then multiply by (2d+3)/10. -60%.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>MICROSCOPIC VISION</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>5 points/level</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You can see details that would normally be invisible without a magnifying glass or a microscope. Each level increases magnification by a factor of 10: 5 points gives 10x, 10 points gives 100x, and so on. This magnification only applies to objects within 1 foot.<br>
Level 1 suffices for ordinary forensic investigation. Level 3 (1,000x) is equivalent to the best optical microscopes. Level 5 (100,000x) is comparable to an electron microscope, capable of imaging viruses. Level 6 (1,000,000x) is on par with a scanning- tunneling or atomic force microscope, and can study an object's atomic structure.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>MIMICRY</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>10 points</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You can duplicate any simple sound (alarm, gunshot, etc.) by listening to it for one second and making a successful IQ roll. You can also imitate voices by spending at least 10 seconds listening to them - live, recorded, or remotely - and making an IQ roll.<br>
This trait gives you no special ability to stun or deafen others with loud sounds, or to speak unpronounceable magic words. Buy any such capabilities separately.<br>
Voice Library: You never forget any sound or voice you've successfully mimicked. It's the player's job to maintain this list. To recall a sample, take a Concentrate maneuver and make an IQ roll. +50%.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>MIND CONTROL</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>50 points</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You can mentally dominate those you can see or touch. To use this ability, concentrate for one second and then roll a Quick Contest: your IQ vs. your subject's Will.<br>
Modifiers: Range penalties to the subject (see p. 550); -1 per slave already under your control; +2 if you concentrate for a full minute, or +4 if you concentrate for a full hour.<br>
If you win, your victim will obey your every command until you free him. In effect, he temporarily gains the Reprogrammable disadvantage (p. 150), with you as his master. Your control persists for as long as you take uninterrupted Concentrate maneuvers. Once you stop, your control lingers for one minute per point by which you won the Quick Contest. (To increase this, add Extended Duration, p. 105.) If you are incapacitated (stunned, knocked out, etc.), or attempt to force the subject to act against his principles (e.g., commit suicide or harm a loved one), roll another Quick Contest. If your victim wins, he breaks free. Roll at the moment of truth - you can march him to the edge of a cliff, but he doesn't roll until he's about to leap.<br>
If you lose, you cannot attempt to control that subject again for 24 hours, and he feels a sense of mental coercion emanating from you. On a critical failure, you also lose control of anyone else under the influence of this ability!<br>
Mind Control often has limitations:<br>
Accessibility (Only on opposite sex), Sense-Based (for hypnotic voices, eyes, scents, etc.), and so on. It may also have attack modifiers, subject to the restrictions that apply to attacks with Malediction (p. 106). Finally, you may apply the Cybernetic and Cybernetic Only modifiers from Mind Reading (see below).<br>
Cinematic Hypnotism: The controller must lock eyes with his victim and hypnotize him in order to give commands. This calls for Vision- Based (-20%). Suggestion (-40%) is common.<br>
Drugs: The attacker uses a drug to make his victim suggestible. This requires a bite, kiss, or more intimate contact. Some time after exposure, the subject gets a HT-based resistance roll. Add Based on HT (+20%), Blood Agent (-40%), Independent (+70%), and Onset (1 minute or 1 hour) (-10% or -20%). If anyone can command the subject, add the Puppet limitation (-40%).<br>
Pheromones: The user exudes an invisible chemical cloud that inspires attraction in those exposed to it. Victims must be within two yards and breathe the gas - this ability doesn't work by touch or sight. The controller can only command one subject per second, at the usual -1 per subject after the first. Add Area Effect 1 (+50%), Emanation (-20%), and Scent-Based (-20%). Accessibility (Only on opposite sex) (-20%) and Emotion Control (-50%) are likely but not required.<br>
Vibrations: The controller emits vibrations that influence emotions. Add Emotion Control (-50%), with Based on HT (+20%) for inaudible vibrations or Hearing-Based (-20%) for audible sounds (common for fantasy bards and mythic sirens).<br>
<hr>
</p><h3 class="card">Special Enhancements</h3><p class="card">
Conditioning: You can reconstruct the subject's psyche and implant suggestions. In effect, you can add or remove any mundane mental disadvantage. Add Delusions for false memories, or Amnesia to wipe memories. Your victim must be under your control, cooperative, and conscious. Roll a second Quick Contest. You are at -1 per full -5 points of disadvantages changed, but you may substitute Brainwashing skill (p. 182) for IQ. Duration in days is equal to your margin of victory. If you win and roll a critical success, the conditioning is permanent! A conditioned subject who is no longer under your direct control imposes no penalty on the use of Mind Control on others. Note that another person with this ability can use it to undo your work. +50%.<br>
No Memory: Your victims have no memory of anything that occurred while under your control. +10%.<br>
Independent: Your Mind Control doesn't require ongoing attention. If it works, you're free to do other things. You must still concentrate to initiate control, but you can't claim the +2 or +4 for lengthy concentration. If the victim fails to resist, control persists for one minute per point by which he lost the Quick Contest; you can't maintain it indefinitely by concentrating. These drawbacks are minor next to the benefits. First, only an attempt to force the subject to act against his principles can break control; you're out of the loop already, so incapacitating you changes nothing. Second, since your attention isn't divided, each contact is separate from all others; there's no -1 per slave, and critical failure with one victim doesn't free the rest. +70%.<br>
<hr>
</p><h3 class="card">Special Limitations</h3><p class="card">
Conditioning Only: You cannot use regular Mind Control - only Conditioning (above). Uncooperative victims must be restrained before you can use your ability. -50%.<br>
Puppet: Your victims have no initiative while under your control, and temporarily acquire Slave Mentality (p. 154). -40%.<br>
Telepathic: Your ability is part of the Telepathy psi power (see p. 257). -10%.<br>
Emotion Control: You can't control the subject's actions, just his feelings. For some guidelines on what's possible, see the Sway Emotions skill (p. B192). Emotion Control is mutually exclusive with Conditioning Only and Suggestion. -50%.<br>
Suggestion: You can't command the subject to take specific actions - you can only suggest a general course of action. Effects are as for Suggest skill (p. B191). Suggestion is mutually exclusive with Conditioning Only and Emotion Control. -40%.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>MIND PROBE</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>20 points</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You can perform a deep mind probe. In effect, you can force the subject to answer any one specific question that he can answer with a brief sentence. To attempt a probe, you must first either touch your subject or successfully read his mind with Mind Reading (below). You must also share a language with him.<br>
To use Mind Probe, you must concentrate for one second and roll a Quick Contest of your IQ (or Interrogation skill, if higher) vs. your subject's Will. If you win, you rip the answer from his mind. The answer is what the subject believes to be true - if he doesn't know, he'll tell you. If you lose, you may try again, at a cumulative -2 per repeated attempt to ask the same (or very similar) question in the past hour. Should you critically fail, you cannot probe that person again for 24 hours.<br>
You may use Mind Probe to ask as many questions as you wish, but each question is a new use of your ability, and requires a second of concentration and its own Quick Contest.<br>
Invasive: Mind Probe only. Your probe works like a mental invasion, not an interrogation. If you win the Quick Contest, you're inside your subject's mental defenses and free to pillage his memories. You're still limited to one question per second, but each answer requires an uncontested roll against IQ, Interrogation, Psychology - or Dreaming, if the subject is sleeping. +75%.<br>
Memory Bank: Mind Probe only. You can store a detailed snapshot of the subject's mind. This requires the usual Quick Contest, but takes an hour. A later IQ roll lets you recall information the subject knew when last probed (just as if you were probing him) or his personality (eliminating penalties to impersonate him with Acting). You can delete a snapshot at any time. +100% if you can store a number of snapshots equal to IQ; +150% for unlimited capacity.<br>
Multiple Contacts: Mind Reading only. You can maintain channels to several minds at once. Roll at a cumulative -1 per contact after the first. You can switch between established contacts without rolling, but you must focus on one contact at a time to read minds. In combat, choose whose mind you're reading each turn. +50%.<br>
Cybernetic: You can affect entities with the Digital Mind trait (p. 48), including all ordinary computers. Your IQ roll has a penalty equal to the system's Complexity. A nonsentient system does not resist; just roll vs. IQ - Complexity to succeed. +50%.<br>
Sensory: You can also tap into your subject's senses. This lets you experience everything he experiences. If he is tortured, knocked out, or killed, the GM may require a Will roll to avoid stunning - or perhaps even a Fright Check! +20%.<br>
Universal: You automatically understand thoughts, even those of nonsapient subjects and those with whom you do not share a language. +50%.<br>
Cybernetic Only: As for Cybernetic, but you can only read Digital Minds. -50%.<br>
Racial: Your ability only works on those of your own race or a very similar race (for instance, humans are similar to elves, but not to dogs or trolls). Combine this with the Sense-Based limitation (Touch or Scent) to represent a race that can share thoughts through biochemical means. -20%.<br>
Sensory Only: As for Sensory, but you can't read thoughts at all. -20%.<br>
Telecommunication: Your ability only works on those with whom you are presently in contact via Telecommunication (p. 91). -20%.<br>
Telepathic: Your ability is part of the Telepathy psi power (see p. 257). -10%.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>MIND READING</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>30 points</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You can eavesdrop on others' surface thoughts. You must be able to see or touch the subject to affect him. Concentrate for one second and roll a Quick Contest of IQ vs. the subject's Will. Modify the roll for range penalties to the subject (see p. 550).<br>
If you win, you can hear everything the subject says, subvocalizes, or actively thinks about as a voice in your head. Received thought comes at the speed of speech. If you do not understand the language, or if your subject isn't sapient, you only pick up feelings, images, and general intent. You can maintain Mind Reading for as long as you wish without further concentration. If you switch to another person, you must stop reading your current subject and roll a Quick Contest with the new subject. To read multiple subjects at once, take Compartmentalized Mind (p. 43).<br>
If you lose, you may try again, at a cumulative -2 per repeated attempt on that subject in the past hour. Should you critically fail, you cannot read that person again for 24 hours.<br>
Mind Reading is often psionic in origin, but it is just as likely to be a magical, divine, or even technological ability.<br>
The Sense-Based limitation (p. 115) - especially Touch-Based - is common. If you take Hearing-Based, you can only read the thoughts of someone whose words you can hear, but can function as a truthreader or (with Universal) a universal translator.<br>

Your shield also resists attempts to locate your mind using magic or psionics. Such abilities must win a Quick Contest against your Will + Mind Shield level to find you.<br>
You may voluntarily lower your Mind Shield if you wish - for instance, to let a friend read your mind. Lowering or raising your shield is a free action, but it must take place at the start of your turn. Mind Shield does protect you while you are asleep or unconscious, unless you fell asleep or were knocked out while your shield was voluntarily lowered.<br>

Limited: Your Mind Shield only works against certain mental attacks. An entire power source (e.g., divine, magical, psionic, or spirit) is -50%; a specific focus, power, or college of magic (e.g., Telepathy or Mind Control spells) is -75%.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>MINDLINK</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>Variable</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You have a permanent telepathic rapport with someone - often a twin, loved one, hive member, etc. You automatically succeed at all attempts to contact him with Telesend (see Telecommunication, p. 91) and Mind Reading (p. 69), provided he chooses not to resist or has Slave Mentality. Mindlink does not allow automatic contact across interstellar distances (more than 0.1 light-year), nor can it reach other dimensions, parallel worlds, etc.<br>
Mindlink costs 5 points for a single person, 10 points for 2-9 people, 20 points for 10-99 people, 30 points for 100-999 people, and so on - add 10 points per tenfold increase in the number of people.<br>
As a rule, the GM should only permit PCs to buy Mindlinks with Allies, Contacts, and Dependents; duplicates (see Duplication, p. 50); and other PCs (if their players permit).<br>
Special Modifiers You may give Mindlink the same modifiers as your Mind Reading or Telesend advantage. In most cases, the GM should require this.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>MODULAR ABILITIES</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>Variable</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You have a pool of character points that you can reallocate under certain conditions. You may rearrange these points to add a skill (spell, technique, etc.) or mental advantage temporarily - or to improve such a trait, if you already have it. When you do, you lose any abilities to which those points were previously assigned.<br>
This advantage comes in slots. A slot can hold one skill or mental advantage at a time. Each slot has a fixed base cost, plus a cost per point in the pool for that slot. Both costs depend on the type of Modular Abilities you have.<br>
Computer Brain: Your abilities are actually computer programs. The GM decides whether a program exists for a given ability. If you have Telecommunication (p. 91), you may download programs, usually from a network. How long this takes depends on the speed of data transfer in the setting - a second per character point works well. In some worlds, you must pay for such programs; $100 per character point is typical. Cost per slot: 6 points base + 4 points per point of abilities.<br>
Chip Slots: As above, but the programs come on physical chips that you must plug into a socket - usually in your skull. It takes three seconds to insert or remove a chip. Chips typically have negligible weight, but cost $100 to $1,000 per point of abilities. Cost per slot: 5 points base + 3 points per point of abilities.<br>
Super-Memorization: You gain new abilities through rapid study. This takes a second per character point. You can forget a memorized ability instantly. You can only memorize abilities if you have a suitable reference work (book, film, tape, etc.). The GM determines the cash cost of such works. Cost per slot: 5 points base + 3 points per point of abilities.<br>
Cosmic Power: You simply wish new abilities into being. This takes one second per ability. Unlike other Modular Abilities, you only ever have one slot, and can rearrange your points into as many or as few abilities as you wish, to the limit of your advantage. 10 points per point of abilities.<br>
Example: Alex buys two Chip Slots at a base cost of 5 points/slot. This costs 10 points. One slot can hold a chip with a single ability worth up to 2 points, and costs 6 points. The other can hold up to 5 points, and costs 15 points. Total cost is 31 points. This appears on Alex's character sheet as Chip Slots 2 (2, 5). Alex will have to buy, borrow, or steal the chips he uses - but he need not pay character points for them.<br>
Use Preparation Required (p. 114) to increase the time needed to rearrange your points, and Limited Use (p. 112) to represent an ability that you forget immediately after using it.<br>
Chip Slots: Use this for cyborgs with removable hardware. This usually means skill chips, but with the Physical enhancement, sockets for standardized equipment modules - Gadget Slots - are an option. Add Limited if these sockets can only accept a specific type of equipment.<br>
Computer Brain: This is for AIs and cyborgs with implanted computers, who download programs instead of plugging them in. The Physical enhancement rarely makes sense, but the Virtual limitation is common and definitely allowed for those who can only use their abilities online or in cyberspace.<br>
Cosmic Power: Ideal for gods and supers! The Physical enhancement is common. Use Limited to confine gods to a sphere of influence or restrict supers to an element. If they shape existing matter or energy, and are powerless without it, add Environmental (p. 110) instead.<br>
Super-Memorization: This suits wizards and cinematic geniuses. Physical is rarely appropriate, as few physical advantages are memorized. Limited frequently restricts use to spells, languages, or specific classes of skills.<br>
Divine Inspiration: Your abilities are minor wishes granted by a Higher Power. You can request nearly any ability at any time (add Physical or Social to have more options). However, your deity - as played by the GM - occasionally overrules you. Reallocating points requires at least a second of prayer per character point. Cost per slot: 6 points base + 4 points per point of abilities.<br>
<hr>
</p><h3 class="card">Special Enhancements</h3><p class="card">
Physical: Your ability is not limited to skills and mental advantages. +50% for physical advantages only, or +100% for any mental or physical ability.<br>
Social: You can add social advantages. Work out how you do this with the GM. If you somehow alter records, the GM may limit available traits to Alternate Identity, Clerical Investment, Independent Income, Legal Enforcement Powers, Legal Immunity, Rank, Security Clearance, Tenure, and Zeroed. +0% for social advantages only; +50% for any mental or social ability. To add any ability, combine Social, +50% with Physical, +100%; other combinations are forbidden.<br>
<hr>
</p><h3 class="card">Special Limitations</h3><p class="card">
Spells Only: Your ability only works with magic spells, which must usually be memorized from a grimoire. This is mutually exclusive with Physical. -20%.<br>
Virtual: The abilities gained only apply in virtual reality, astral space, or another limited realm. -50%.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>NEUTRALIZE</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>50 points</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You can neutralize the psi powers of a single psionic individual. This is an active ability with an ongoing effect on the subject. It does not have to be psionic - it might represent a magical or high-tech way to drain psi abilities. To use Neutralize, you must touch the subject (requires an Attack maneuver) and win a Quick Contest of Will. If you succeed, you successfully neutralize all your victim's psionic powers (see Chapter 6) for a number of minutes equal to your margin of victory. This has no effect on the subject's psionic Talents. Once you have neutralized someone, you cannot affect him again until his power recovers. A critical failure with this ability cripples it for 1d hours.<br>
<hr>
</p><h3 class="card">Special Enhancements</h3><p class="card">
Power Theft: When you successfully neutralize a psi, you acquire his powers! You gain all the psionic abilities you neutralized - including their enhancements and limitations - for the duration. You can't use Neutralize again until these powers wear off. +200%.<br>
<hr>
</p><h3 class="card">Special Limitations</h3><p class="card">
One Power: You can only neutralize a specific psionic power; e.g., ESP or Telepathy. See Chapter 6 for a list of standard psi powers. -50%.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>NICTITATING MEMBRANE</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>1 point/level</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You have a transparent lens over your eyes that you can open and close like an eyelid. This lets you see normally underwater, and protects your eyes from sand, irritants, etc. Each level of Nictitating Membrane provides your eyes (only) with DR 1 and adds +1 to all HT rolls concerned with eye damage.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>NIGHT VISION</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>1 point/level</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>Your eyes adapt rapidly to darkness. Each level of this ability (maximum nine levels) allows you to ignore -1 in combat or vision penalties due to darkness, provided there is at least some light.<br>
Example: Night Vision 4 would completely eliminate darkness penalties up to -4, and would reduce a penalty of -7 to only -3.<br>
Regardless of level, Night Vision only works in partial darkness. It has no effect on the -10 for total darkness (for that, get Dark Vision, p. 47).</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>NO HANGOVER</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>1 point</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>No matter how much you drink, you will never get a hangover. This does not mitigate the effects of intoxication – it just eliminates the unpleasant aftereffects.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>OBSCURE</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>2 points/level</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You produce an effect that actively jams one particular sense, making it difficult to detect you and everything in your vicinity. You must specify the affected sense. This can be one of the five human senses or a sensory advantage such as Infravision, Radar, or one particular Detect. Examples include Obscure (Vision) for fog, Obscure (Hearing) for white noise, and Obscure (Radar) for electronic jamming.<br>
Obscure affects a two-yard radius centered on you. Add the Area Effect enhancement (p. 102) to increase this radius. The affected sense is at -1 per level of Obscure to detect anything within your radius. Ten levels will block the sense completely. The boundaries of the zone are easily detected by the affected sense, however; roll at +1 per level.<br>
Clairsentience: Obscure usually blocks one sense, whether the observer examines the affected area in person or remotely. A supernatural or superscience anti-power might specifically prevent all remote sensing without affecting any mundane senses. Obscure (Clairsentience) often has Extended for Detect, Divination, or Para-Radar (+20% each) and Limited, Psi (-20%).<br>
Detect: An effect that actively jams a specialized sensor should have Obscure against the equivalent Detect. For instance, Obscure (Detect Magnetic Fields) would work against magnetic anomaly detectors. Other forms of Obscure might affect supernatural versions of Detect - imagine a demon with Obscure (Detect Evil)!<br>
Divination: Obscure (Divination) is legitimate, and affects all attempts to gather facts from within the area through such means as Information spells and Psychometry. Use Obscure (Clairsentience) to disrupt remote viewing.<br>
Hearing: This might represent a magical stealth spell, white noise, or ultra-tech sound cancellation. Regular hearing, Subsonic Hearing, Ultrasonic Hearing, Sonar, and Vibration Sense are all related for the purpose of the Extended enhancement. Obscure (Subsonic Hearing) and (Ultrahearing) suffice to evade geophones and ultrasonic motion detectors, respectively. Discriminatory Hearing, Parabolic Hearing, and so on aren't unique senses; they merely make hearing more useful. Those who have such traits have no special ability to ignore Obscure.<br>
Scanning Sense: Treat Radar and Imaging Radar as the same sense for the purpose of Obscure. Other Scanning Senses require separate versions of Obscure. These varieties of Obscure nearly always represent jamming of some kind. For the purpose of the Extended enhancement, Ladar is related to all kinds of vision, while Sonar is related to Vibration Sense and all types of hearing. In most settings, Para-Radar is related to Clairsentience and Detect.<br>
Vision: This could be darkness, blinding light, fog, smoke, or a magical blurring spell. Regular vision, Infravision, Ultravision, and Ladar are all related for the purpose of the Extended enhancement. Obscure (Infravision) also interferes with heatseeking missiles and infrared motion detectors. Microscopic and Telescopic Vision, Peripheral Vision, etc. aren't unique senses; they just make vision more useful. Those with such advantages have no special ability to ignore Obscure.<br>
Penalties for Obscure also apply to any form of Telecommunication (p. 81) that uses the same type of signal as the blocked senses, if the sender or receiver is inside the area of effect. Infrared Communication works like Infravision, Laser Communication works like Ladar, Radio works like Radar, and so on. It's up to the GM whether Telesend works like Para- Radar.<br>
By default, Obscure is a detectable jamming field (e.g., darkness, electronic noise, or white noise) or cloud (anti-laser aerosol, radar-defeating chaff, smoke, etc.) around the user. Without special modifiers, it impedes signals crossing it in either direction. There are two common exceptions to these assumptions:<br>
Stealth Field: A subtle effect that prevents detection of the user and the field itself is standard for magic and psionics, and common for superscience cloaking. This requires Stealthy (+100%). Supernatural versions rarely inconvenience the user, and also have Defensive (+50%). Ultratech devices generally block the user's sensors, too.<br>
Weapon: Many supers and vehicles shoot beams or projectiles that cause these effects at a distance; e.g., flares for Obscure (Infravision) or smoke bombs for Obscure (Vision). Give such abilities Ranged (+50%). Don't add Stealthy to anything that's supposed to work as a decoy or distraction.<br>
<hr>
</p><h3 class="card">Special Enhancements</h3><p class="card">
Defensive: You are unaffected by your own Obscure ability. +50%.<br>
Extended: Each related sense (Infravision as well as normal vision, Sonar as well as normal hearing, etc.) blocked beyond the first is +20%.<br>
Ranged: You produce your obscuring effect at a distant point rather than around your body. This is a ranged attack with 1/2D -, Max 100, Acc 3, RoF 1, Shots N/A, and Recoil 1. Duration is 10 seconds. You can apply other modifiers to change these statistics. Unlike the usual Ranged enhancement (p. 107), this modifier lets you use your ability again before its duration has expired (e.g., to simulate multiple smoke grenades); thus, it is more expensive. +50%.<br>
Stealthy: Your ability works invisibly, like a magical zone of silence. There is no bonus to detect the boundaries of your area of effect. +100%.<br>
<hr>
</p><h3 class="card">Special Limitations</h3><p class="card">
Always On: You cannot turn this ability off. -50%.<br>
Limited: You can only block a sense that occurs as part of a power. An entire power source (e.g., magical or psionic) is -20%; a specific power (e.g., ESP or Telepathy) is -40%.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>ORACLE</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>15 points</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You are sensitive to omens, and see hidden significance in such things as the way plants grow, the behavior of animals, and even changes in the weather and the sky. Once per day, you may check the omens. This normally requires at least an hour, but if the GM has something in particular he wants to communicate, he may arbitrarily put it in your path. The GM rolls twice, in secret, when you use this ability: once to determine whether you discover the omen, once to see if you interpret it correctly.<br>
This ability differs from Precognition (p. 77), which requires no interpretation.<br>
Discovery: To detect an omen requires a Sense roll. On a success, you discover the omen; on a critical success, you get +5 on the subsequent interpretation roll. On a failure, you find nothing of oracular significance. On a critical failure, the GM lies - he tells you that you have found an omen, but this is, in reality, a product of your own fears or wishes.<br>
Interpretation: To interpret an omen requires an IQ roll. On a success, the omen is very general; e.g., an enemy approaches or a great power, long dormant, is stirring. On a critical success, the information is more specific: you risk the wrath of the king, seek out the mage in the tower, etc. On a failure, the omen is simply too vague to be useful. On a critical failure, you blatantly misinterpret the omen - possibly in a dangerous manner.<br>
Oracle (Digital): You can analyze live data - the Internet, news feeds, etc. - and spot items of hidden mundane significance. Roll against Research skill for discovery and Intelligence Analysis skill for interpretation. To use this ability, you must have access to prodigious quantities of unprocessed data. This trait is especially appropriate for AIs and other Digital Minds. 15 points.<br>
Inspired: You're extremely gifted. Any successful interpretation roll provides you with specific information, and a critical success brings you an unambiguous vision of the truth. +100%.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>PARABOLIC HEARING</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>4 points/level</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You can zoom in on a particular sound or area, and can filter out background noise from sounds of interest to you. Each level of Parabolic Hearing doubles the distance at which you can clearly hear any given sound (see Hearing, p. 358).</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>PATRONS</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>Variable</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>A Patron is an NPC - or even an entire organization - that serves as your advisor, employer, mentor, or protector. An employer must be exceptional to qualify as a Patron, though; a Patron is much more than an ordinary boss!<br>
<hr>
Power<br>
The base point cost of a Patron depends on its power. Use the categories below as a guide, but note that some Patrons won't fit neatly into any of them. The GM's word is final.<br>
A powerful individual (usually built on at least 150% of the PC's starting points) or a fairly powerful organization (assets of at least 1,000 times starting wealth for the world). 10 points.<br>
An extremely powerful individual (built on at least twice the PC's starting points) or a powerful organi zation (assets of at least 10,000 times starting wealth). Examples: a limited manifestation of a minor god, a billionaire, or a big-city police department. 15 points.<br>
An ultra-powerful individual (built on as many points as the GM wants!) or a very powerful organization (assets of at least 100,000 times starting wealth). Examples: a super, a limited manifestation of a major god, or a big city. 20 points.<br>
An extremely powerful organization (assets of at least 1 million times starting wealth). Examples: a large corporation or a very small nation. 25 points.<br>
A national government or giant multinational organization (net worth basically incalculable), or a true god who appears personally to intervene on your behalf. 30 points.<br>
Note that the base cost to have a deity as a Patron is comparable to that for a powerful mundane Patron, but divine power requires the Special Abilities enhancement (see below), which will greatly increase the final cost of a divine Patron!<br>
<hr>
Frequency of Appearance<br>
Choose a frequency of appearance, as explained under Frequency of Appearance (p. 36). If the GM determines that your Patron appears at the start of an adventure, he may design the adventure to include an assignment or aid from the Patron. He may also choose to leave out your Patron, if its appearance would make no sense or disrupt the adventure.<br>
However, if the GM determined that your Patron could have appeared, and you try to contact your Patron during the adventure (for help, advice, etc.), then the contact is likely to be successful and you may receive aid. (Within reason - if you're locked in a dungeon without any means of communication, you won't be contacting anybody.) You will not know whether your Patron is available on a given adventure until you attempt to request aid. As a rule, you should only be able to reach your Patron for help once per adventure.<br>
Remember that a powerful Patron could be helpful without actually intervening! A Chicago hood who can say, I'm from Big Eddie, or a crimefighter who can flash a Q-clearance card, may carry some extra weight in a tough spot.<br>
<hr>
Party Patrons<br>
Often, several PCs - perhaps the entire party - share a Patron (they are all agents of the same government, servants of the same cult, etc.). No matter how many characters share a Patron, the cost is not shared; each character must pay full price for the Patron. On the other hand, the GM will make an appearance roll for each character at the start of each adventure - and if the Patron appears for any of them, then it is usually available for all of them. The GM should scale the quality and quantity of the aid provided in proportion to the number of successful appearance rolls.<br>
<hr>
Drawbacks of Patrons<br>
If your Patron is an army, corporation, feudal lord, etc., you may owe it a Duty (p. 133). A god or similar Patron may require a stringent code of behavior in return for its aid; see Self- Imposed Mental Disadvantages (p. 121). A Patron might also have powerful foes that are now your foes; this can give you an Enemy (p. 135). Such factors can cut the effective cost of a Patron significantly, and turn it from a benefit to a considerable liability!<br>
<hr>
Employers and Patrons<br>
Not every employer is a Patron. If you can depend on your employer to get you out of trouble (at least sometimes), it might really be a Patron. Otherwise, it's just a job. For example, a small police department is a 10- point Patron if, as most do, it takes care of its own. But the U.S. Army, though powerful, is not a likely Patron - at least for an ordinary trooper. You could say, The Colonel takes care of his men. But you could just as easily say, I'm on my own if I get in trouble, and play a soldier who does not have a Patron.<br>
<hr>
Examples of Patrons<br>
* A powerful wizard as Patron to warriors (or young wizards) whom he sends to find magical items or slay foes.<br>
* A crime lord as Patron to freelance thieves or assassins.<br>
* A minor deity as Patron to a traveling Righter of Wrongs.<br>
* A local police department as Patron to a private detective. (They might find him annoying at times, but he helps them out, and vice versa.) * A local ruler (in any world) as Patron to an adventurer.<br>
* A large company as Patron to a troubleshooter or spy.<br>
* A super-crimefighter or politician as Patron to a news reporter.<br>
* Any intelligence organization as occasional Patron to a freelance operative, or full-time Patron to its own agents. (The difference between this and ordinary jobs is that you can't quit . . .)<br>
You can apply the following modifiers after multiplying for frequency of appearance.<br>
<hr>
</p><h3 class="card">Special Enhancements</h3><p class="card">
Equipment: Your Patron supplies useful equipment that you can use for your own purposes, and that you would otherwise have to buy. This enhancement only applies if the equipment is yours once given. A soldier with a military Patron would not pay extra for his weapons, since when he goes off duty, he can't take them along. An adventurer in the employ of a generous noble who hands out useful gifts would pay extra. +50% if the equipment is worth no more than the average starting wealth in the campaign, or +100% if it is worth more than that.<br>
Highly Accessible: You can attempt to contact your Patron at any time - even when you are locked in a dungeon, lost in the desert, etc. This is most appropriate if your Patron is a spirit, a god you can petition via prayer, etc. +50%.<br>
Special Abilities: Your Patron wields power out of proportion to its wealth or point value. +50% if your Patron has extensive social or political power (e.g., the Governor of New York or the Pope), or +100% if your Patron has magical powers in a nonmagical world, possesses equipment from a TL greater than yours, grants you special powers, or has unusual reach in time or space (e.g., a super, spirit, or god).<br>
<hr>
</p><h3 class="card">Special Limitations</h3><p class="card">
Minimal Intervention: Your Patron is less useful than its power level would suggest. On a successful appearance roll, the GM makes a reaction roll for your Patron to determine whether it actually provides aid; see Requests for Aid (p. 562). On a Neutral or better reaction, you receive the aid your Patron thinks you need - which may or may not be what you want. This is the classic modifier for gods who have many other minions to aid, and frequently accompanies the Pact limitation (see p. 113). -50%.<br>
Secret: Your Patron works behind the scenes. You do not know who it is and you cannot request aid directly. You might be able to call for help in such a way that the Patron gets the message (GM's decision), but there is no guarantee that the Patron will take action. The only evidence of this kind of Patron is minor incidents and lucky breaks. This may take the form of information, equipment, or even direct aid . . . but only when it suits the Patron, and always in an untraceable way. A Patron like this often regards its aid as an investment on which it expects some return; therefore, it might not have your best interests at heart! Only the GM knows any of these details. You know nothing other than the fact that you have a Patron. -50%.<br>
Unwilling: You obtained your Patron through coercion (e.g., blackmail). It provides aid only because there is no other choice, and it definitely does not have your best interests at heart! You will eventually make one request too many (GM's judgment - perhaps if the appearance roll comes up 18) and lose the Patron: remove the Patron from your character sheet and lower your point value accordingly. Since a Patron is by definition more powerful than you are, taking an Unwilling Patron is risky. If the Patron can find a way to break your hold, it will, and may well become an Enemy! -50%.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>PAYLOAD</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>1 point/level</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You can carry cargo or occupants inside your body! This might be a superficial feature (e.g., a surgically implanted flesh pocket or a natural pouch like that of a kangaroo) or an actual internal compartment. The latter is not just for machines - a zombie might have a colony of spiders or snakes living in its body, for example.<br>
Each level of Payload lets you carry up to Basic Lift/10 lbs. inside you. Those without Injury Tolerance (Homogenous) (p. 60) or the Machine meta-trait (p. 263) should ask the GM's permission before taking more than five levels of Payload. You must allocate your Payload between cargo and occupants when you buy the advantage:<br>
Cargo: 20 lbs. of cargo space is roughly equal to one cubic foot of capacity. A typical car has about 10-20 cubic feet of storage space; a semitrailer has about 2,400 cf.<br>
Occupants: A human-sized being requires about 200 lbs. of capacity. For others, take average racial weight and increase it by 1/3. An actual cabin requires 10 times that weight. Your defensive advantages (DR, Sealed, etc.) also protect your occupants. If your occupants can control you, buy Controls separately - see Compartmentalized Mind (p. 43).<br>
Treat your Payload as part of your body, not as encumbrance or carried weight, when calculating Move and using advantages with limited carrying capacity, such as Invisibility, Jumper, and Warp.<br>
Machines that can push or pull large external loads - or pick them up and carry them with arms, cranes, etc. - have Lifting ST (p. 65), not Payload. Ordinary cars and trucks have Payload, but forklifts, tugboats, and the like should buy Lifting ST to represent their abilities.<br>
<hr>
</p><h3 class="card">Special Limitations</h3><p class="card">
Exposed: Your Payload cannot be concealed and is not protected by your defensive advantages. You can apply this to any portion of your Payload. The main use of this limitation is to create motorcycles and similar unenclosed vehicles. -50%.</p,></div></div>

<div><h2 class='points'>10 points/level</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>Penetrating Vision (sometimes called X-ray vision) lets you see through solid objects. Each level of this advantage allows you to see through up to six inches of normal matter. You can just barely see the outline of the substance you are looking through - not enough to impair vision in any way. Penetrating Vision automatically works in conjunction with all your other vision advantages (Infravision, Ultravision, etc.).<br>

This lets you walk along a tightrope, ledge, tree limb, or other anchored surface without having to make a die roll. If the surface is wet, slippery, or unstable, you get +6 on all rolls to keep your feet. In combat, you get +4 to DX and DX-based skill rolls to keep your feet or avoid being knocked down. Finally, you get +1 to Acrobatics, Climbing, and Piloting skills.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>PERIPHERAL VISION</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>15 points</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You have an unusually wide field of vision. You can see a 180° arc in front of you without turning your head, and have 30° of peripheral vision to either side of that. This gives you a 240° arc of vision for observation and ranged attacks. The figure above [[pic]] shows the arc of vision for a normal character (white) and for someone with Peripheral Vision (gray plus white).<br>
If you are playing with a battle map, you can make melee attacks into side (right and left) hexes as well as front hexes - although a onehanded attack to the opposite side (e.g., attacking your left hex with your right hand) is clumsy and considered a Wild Swing (see p. 388). You still cannot attack a foe directly behind you except with a Wild Swing.<br>
This also helps on defense! If you are attacked from a side hex, you defend at no penalty. Even against attacks from the rear, your active defense is only at -2.<br>
Out of combat, you get +3 to all rolls to detect Shadowing attempts or ambushes from behind, and the GM will always make a Vision roll for you to spot dangers behind your back.<br>

</p><h3 class="card">Special Limitations</h3><p class="card">
Easy to Hit: Your eyes are on stalks, unusually large, or otherwise more vulnerable to attack. Others can target your eyes from within their arc of vision at only -6 to hit. -20%.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>PERMEATION</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>Variable</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You can move through a particular solid material as if it didn't exist. You do not open a passage behind you; observers just see you melt into the surface and disappear. You need Penetrating Vision (p. 74) to see where you're going. You must still breathe (unless you have Doesn't Breathe), which limits trips to the length of time you can hold your breath (see Holding Your Breath, p. 351).<br>
Permeation differs from Insubstantiality. You are affected by gravity, and you are limited to normal movement; if you lack Flight or another movement advantage, you must walk at your Basic Move. Furthermore, you can be affected by any attack that can reach you within a solid object. You also remain vulnerable to attacks with the material you can pass through, unless you purchase Damage Resistance to such attacks.<br>
Cost depends on how often you are likely to encounter the material you can permeate in the form of a barrier. For instance, paper might be a Common substance, but since walls of paper are uncommon, it is treated as Rare for the purpose of Permeation.<br>
Very Common: Earth (including clay, mud, and sand), metal, stone (including brick, concrete, and plaster), wood, and other ubiquitous structural materials. 40 points.<br>
Common: Concrete, plastic, steel, and other specific, common structural materials. 20 points.<br>
Occasional: Glass, ice (including snow), sand, and anything else that a normal person could eventually break or tunnel through using muscle power, as well as somewhat unusual structural materials, such as aluminum and copper. 10 points.<br>
Rare: Bone, flesh, paper, and other materials rarely encountered in large quantities or as barriers. 5 points.<br>
<hr>
</p><h3 class="card">Special Enhancements</h3><p class="card">
Can Carry Objects: Normally, you cannot carry anything while moving through matter. This enhancement lets you carry objects, including clothing and armor. If dropped, they pop into open space at the point where you entered the material. You cannot leave things inside solid matter! No encumbrance is +10%; Light, +20%; Medium, +50%; Heavy, +100%.<br>
Tunnel: You can leave a tunnel (of about your size) behind you, if you choose. This rearranges the object you are moving though without inflicting damage, and does not work at all on living targets. For an ability that can rip holes in objects and people, see Innate Attack (p. 61). +40%.<br>
Extended: You can pass through multiple, similar materials. Buy the most expensive one at full price. Each additional, related substance is +20%. For instance, someone with Permeation (Stone) could add Extended, Earth and Metal for +40%.<br>
Meld 1: You can become one with the things you permeate, like a dryad merging with her tree. This works only on discrete objects - a tree (not a forest), a mountain (not a planet), etc. Once melded, you can use your senses from or step out of the object at any point along its interior or exterior surfaces, and can breathe if any part of it is touching air. Take a Ready maneuver to shift viewpoints or exit the object. If the object takes damage, it affects you proportionally; e.g., 10 HP of injury to a 100 HP tree results in a 1 HP wound for a 10 HP man. Being part of something larger than you also blunts Afflictions: add the difference between its SM and yours to your resistance roll. If you have attacks that affect those touching or standing near you, like Emanations, they're spread thin if you merge with a large object: scale down damage in proportion to HP (to 1/10 normal, in the above example), and add the difference between the object's SM and your own to rolls to resist your Afflictions. You can't control the items you meld with; get Possession for that. +150%.<br>
Meld 2: As Meld 1, but works even on distributed objects. With Permeation (Earth), you could meld with the ground at your feet to cross the entire planet in the blink of an eye; with Permeation (Wood), you could meld with a forest to traverse it instantly or spy on events within. +300%.<br>
Finite Thickness: You can only pass through a barrier of limited thickness. If you try to move through anything thicker, you penetrate as far as your limit and then run into a solid obstacle. Value depends on thickness: -50% for a thin membrane (like a curtain), -30% for an inch, -15% for a foot, and -5% for the distance you can sprint in a second.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>PHYSICAL APPEARANCE</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>Varies</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>Appearance is mostly a “special effect” – you may choose any physical appearance you like. At minimum, note the color of your skin, hair, and eyes (or other features appropriate to your race: scales, feathers, paint job, etc.). However, certain traits count as advantages or disadvantages.<br>
<hr>
Appearance Levels<br>
Appearance is rated in levels. Most people have “Average” appearance, for 0 points. Good looks give a reaction bonus; this is an advantage and costs points. Unappealing looks give a reaction penalty; this is a disadvantage, and gives you back points. These reaction modifiers only affect those who can see you! Those who cannot see you might have to make a new reaction roll upon first meeting you in person (GM’s option).<br>
Reaction modifiers due to appearance only affect members of your own race, a very similar race, or a dissimilar race that finds your race attractive (for whatever reason). In all cases, the GM’s word is final; humans are “very similar” to elves, but bug-eyed monsters are unlikely to care about a human’s appearance except in a silly campaign.<br>
Horrific: You are indescribably monstrous or unspeakably foul, and cannot interact with normal mortals. This gives -6 on reaction rolls. The GM may decide that this trait is supernatural and unavailable to normal characters. -24 points.<br>
Monstrous: You are hideous and clearly unnatural. Most people react to you as a monster rather than a sapient being. This gives -5 on reaction rolls. Again, this trait might not be appropriate for normal characters. -20 points.<br>
Hideous: You have any sort of disgusting looks you can come up with: a severe skin disease, wall-eye . . . preferably several things at once. This gives -4 on reaction rolls. -16 points.<br>
Ugly: As above, but not so bad – maybe only stringy hair and snaggle teeth. This gives -2 on reaction rolls. -8 points.<br>
Unattractive: You look vaguely unappealing, but it’s nothing anyone can put a finger on. This gives -1 on reaction rolls. -4 points.<br>
Average: Your appearance gives you no reaction modifiers either way; you can blend easily into a crowd. A viewer’s impression of your looks depends on your behavior. If you smile and act friendly, you will be remembered as pleasant-looking; if you frown and mutter, you will be remembered as unattractive. 0 points.<br>
Attractive: You don’t enter beauty contests, but are definitely good-looking. This gives +1 on reaction rolls. 4 points.<br>
Handsome (or Beautiful): You could enter beauty contests. This gives +4 on reaction rolls made by those attracted to members of your sex, +2 from everyone else. 12 points.<br>
Very Handsome (or Very Beautiful): You could win beauty contests – regularly. This gives +6 on reaction rolls made by those attracted to members of your sex, +2 from others. Exception: Members of the same sex with reason to dislike you (more than -4 in reaction penalties, regardless of bonuses) resent your good looks, and react at -2 instead. As well, talent scouts, friendly drunks, slave traders, and other nuisances are liable to become a problem for you. 16 points.<br>
Transcendent: You are an “ideal specimen.” This gives +8 (!) on reaction rolls made by those attracted to members of your sex, +2 from others, and all the troublesome side effects of Very Handsome. The GM is free to reserve this trait for angels, deities, and the like. Such entities frequently possess Charisma (p. 41) or Terror (p. 93) as well. 20 points.<br>
<hr>
Special Options<br>
The following options are available for above-average appearance, and do not affect point costs: Androgynous: If your appearance is Handsome (Beautiful) or better, you may specify that your looks appeal equally to both sexes. You get a flat reaction modifier instead of a sexdependent bonus: +3 for Handsome, +4 for Very Handsome, or +5 for Transcendent. Impressive: If you are Attractive or better, you can specify that you have exceptional physical presence that doesn’t manifest as sexual magnetism. This is typical of tigers and aged royalty. If your appearance is Handsome (Beautiful) or above, use the “flat” reaction bonuses given for Androgynous.<br>
<hr>
</p><h3 class="card">Special Enhancements</h3><p class="card">
Universal: Your reaction modifier applies to everyone who can see you, regardless of race. If your appearance is Handsome (Beautiful) or above, use the “flat” reaction bonuses given for Androgynous. This modifier is most common for Hideous or worse monsters and for Attractive or better gods, faeries, and the like. The GM may deem it off-limits to normal mortals. +25%.<br>
<hr>
</p><h3 class="card">Special Limitations</h3><p class="card">
Off-the-Shelf Looks: You can apply this to any appearance better than Attractive. Through ultra-tech or magic, your looks are a variation on a standard type or famous person. You’re as beautiful as ever, but you get half the usual reaction bonus with people from your own culture, because they’ve seen it all before. (“Oh, look! Another Mr. Universe 2003!”) -50%.<br>
[[Category:GURPS Advantages]][[Category:GURPS Disadvantages]]</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>PITIABLE</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>5 points</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>Something about you makes people pity you and want to take care of you. You get +3 on all reaction rolls from those who consider you to be in a position of helplessness, weakness, or need (which never includes those with the Callous disadvantage). Taken in conjunction with above-average looks, Pitiable means you are “cute” instead of “sexy”; in combination with below-average looks, it means you are “appealingly homely,” like a basset hound.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>PLANT EMPATHY</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>5 points</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You have an unusual rapport with growing things. On encountering a plant, the GM will roll against your IQ. On a success, he will give you a general sense of its health and whether it is natural or supernatural in origin. Furthermore, this advantage functions as Empathy (p. 51) with respect to sentient plants, and allows you to use your Influence skills (see p. 359) on such entities, which will usually ensure a positive reaction.<br>
This ability frequently accompanies some level of Green Thumb (see Talent, p. 89) and often Sense of Duty (Plants) or Vow (Use plant material only if gathered without severe injury to the plant).</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>POSSESSION</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>100 points</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You can move your consciousness from body to body. In theory, you could live forever this way, moving from dying bodies to healthy ones. However, you cannot survive outside a living host. Should your current body die, you will die! Thus, you must keep your current host alive . . . at least until you can find a replacement.<br>
To possess a new host, you must concentrate for one second and physically touch him. Attempts to possess your own Puppet (p. 78) succeed automatically. In all other cases, roll a Quick Contest: your IQ vs. the subject's Will. Your victim resists at +5 if he is in combat with you or otherwise wary of you, so it is best to be subtle.<br>
If you lose or tie, you are mentally stunned for 1d seconds. In addition, you may never attempt to possess that subject again - he is immune to you.<br>
If you win, you take over your victim's body, completely suppressing his personality. Your previous host regains control of his body (if sentient) after 1d seconds of mental stun, and comes to with no memory of the possession.<br>
You gain your new host's ST, DX, and HT (and secondary characteristics calculated from these scores), as well as his physical advantages and disadvantages. You keep your own IQ, Perception, and Will, and all of your mental traits. Your social traits may apply, depending on the laws and values of your society.<br>
Skills are a special case. Your IQ-, Perception-, and Will-based skills are unchanged. Other skills remain at the same relative skill level. For instance, if you have Acrobatics at DX+3, then you would have Acrobatics-12 in a DX 9 body and Acrobatics-14 in a DX 11 body.<br>
If you occupy a sentient host, you have sufficient access to his memories for the first few hours of the takeover to learn his name and daily routine, but not enough to learn IQ-based skills. To recall a specific fact from the host's memories, you must roll vs. IQ, at -1 per hour since the takeover. Only one attempt is allowed for any given memory!<br>
If you occupy a host for a long time, or hop between multiple bodies, the GM is free to adjust your point value to reflect the most expensive body you regularly occupy. For more on this subject, see Chapter 9.<br>
With suitable modifiers, Possession can represent diverse abilities seen in speculative fiction. Note that the Digital, Magical, Parasitic, Spiritual, and Telepathic limitations are mutually exclusive.<br>
Magical Possession: Some unpleasant horror and fantasy monsters use magic to take over unwary victims . . . who inevitably turn on their companions. This calls for the Magical special limitation (-10%), which is identical to the Magical power modifier (p. 27). Some of these creatures jump from body to body, but most stay in their own body and use their victims remotely via Telecontrol (+50% or +100%).<br>
Parasitic Possession: Body-snatching aliens are a staple of science fiction. All such beings have the Parasitic limitation (-60%); more realistic ones also have Specialized. Some terrifying creatures have Assimilation (+10%), too - possibly with Full Memory Access (+10%). With access to the skills of all previous victims, they're formidable foes. It's equally creepy when the host exhibits the invader's mannerisms but none of his own. For that, use No Memory Access (-10%) instead.<br>
Psionic Possession: Telepaths capable of Possession require the Telepathic power modifier (-10%). Most fictional psis don't move from body to body, but manipulate victims remotely via Telecontrol (+50% or +100%). A few do swap bodies using Mind Swap (+10%). An adept telepath who can do both needs Mind Swap, Telecontrol, and Selectivity (+10%).<br>
Spiritual Possession: Demons, loas, and other spirits in folklore can possess mortals. This calls for Spiritual (-20%). Spiritual isn't the same as the Spirit power modifier (p. 28) - it's about being a spirit, not controlling spirits - and it's rare for both to apply. Few spirits have any power modifier on their Possession. Weak spirits that can ride only a few specific subjects have Puppet Only (-30%). Powerful ones that can create new Puppets have Chronic (+20%) instead. The GM may let those without the Spirit meta-trait take Spiritual if they have Insubstantiality or a trait modified with Projection, and are subject to countermeasures equivalent to exorcism. The GM may also let those with Spiritual possess inanimate objects (e.g., statues), which resist with HT - although this is only useful if the possessor has Telekinesis with Animation to animate his new vessel.<br>
Technological Possession: There's no unique type of superscience Possession. Digital (-40%) works for Digital Minds that can possess computers; Chronic (+20%) is extremely common in this case, and represents rewriting the target's software. Those who can teleoperate others through surgical implants should take Telecontrol (+50%), Mindlink Required (-40%), and No Memory Access (-10%), and must have Mindlink (p. B70) with the Telecommunication limitation.<br>
<hr>
</p><h3 class="card">Special Enhancements</h3><p class="card">
Assimilation: When you enter a new body, you may choose to forget any of your current skills and use the points this frees up - and any unspent points - to learn ST-, DX-, or HT-based skills known by the host, at up to (host's level)-1. For instance, if you do not know Acrobatics, but your host knows it at DX+3, you can pick it up at DX+2 . . . if you have enough points. Skills forgotten in order to learn new skills are gone. Skills learned from your host will move from body to body with you. +10%.<br>
Chronic: When you exit a host, you can leave a back door that lets you possess him again without a Quick Contest. This lets you buy your former host as a Puppet. You can only use this enhancement if you have enough unspent points to buy a Puppet at the time you leave your host. +20%.<br>
Mind Swap: Your host's mind moves into your previous body instead of being suppressed - in effect, you trade places. +10%.<br>
Telecontrol: You remotely control your new host as if he were a puppet, leaving your original body in a trance.<br>
You may choose to return to your body at any time, and must do so if your host falls unconscious or dies (but not if he sleeps). As a result, you do not die if your host dies. +50%.<br>
Full Memory Access: You can freely access the memories of a sentient host at any time. To recall a specific fact from the subject's memories requires a straight IQ roll, at no penalty for the time since takeover. Furthermore, if you also have Assimilation, you can learn the victim's IQ-, Will-, and Perception-based skills. +10%.<br>
Telecontrol 2: As Telecontrol, but your body remains conscious and able to act. You can only exercise fine control over one body at a time, though. State whether you're prioritizing your body or your victim's (in combat, do this at the start of each turn). All actions taken by the lower-priority body - including attack, defense, and Sense rolls - are at -4. This is incompatible with Parasitic and Spiritual, which assume that you and your victim are merged in a single body. If you have Compartmentalized Mind (p. B43), you don't need this modifier, as some compartments can possess victims while others control your body. Without Telesend (p. B91), though, the home and away compartments won't be in communication. +100%.<br>
<hr>
</p><h3 class="card">Special Limitations</h3><p class="card">
Digital: This limitation is only available to Digital Minds (p. 48). You take over computers, not living bodies. The target system must be connected to your current host computer via a network, and you must have complete access to it - voluntary or otherwise (see Computer Hacking, p. 184). The target computer's hardware must be complex enough to run your computer program; in general, its Complexity must be at least half your IQ (round up). You can also take over a computer using a copy of yourself while leaving the original intact! However, unless you have the Digital version of Duplication (p. 50), any system you take over this way becomes an independent NPC that thinks it is you. This can be good or bad - the duplicate could become any type of Associated NPC (see p. 31). -40%.<br>
Magical: Your advantage is an innate magic talent. If the subject is protected by a spell that repels hostile magic, you must win a Quick Contest of your IQ vs. that spell before you can make a possession attempt. If your victim has Magic Resistance, it subtracts from your IQ and adds to his Will during the actual possession attempt. -10%.<br>
Mindlink Required: You can only possess someone with whom you have a Mindlink. If the link is ever jammed, out of range, etc., the possession ends. If the Mindlink has the Telecommunication limitation, Mindlink Required can represent control via an implant, telepresence, or similar technology. -40%.<br>
No Memory Access: You have no access to your host's memories. -10%.<br>
Parasitic: You enter your host's body physically. You must have Permeation (Flesh) (p. 75) to do this, unless your host has sufficient Payload (p. 74) to contain you - and your victim must have a higher Size Modifier than you. After entering your victim's body, you may attempt to possess him. He resists with the higher of HT or Will. You aren't forced out if you lose, but he is immune to you, so you need to find another host soon. While you are in someone else's body, he (if he is still uncontrolled) or his friends might be able to use technological means to detect you - and possibly remove you. Attacks that penetrate or ignore your host's DR can injure you, but his HP act as extra DR for this purpose. If you are microbial, you should purchase Injury Tolerance (Diffuse) (p. 60), which will protect you. The host nourishes you, and may have to eat extra food as a result. You can choose to leave at any time, the same way you entered. You may also temporarily release your host while continuing occupation. If you do, you will have to win a new Quick Contest to regain control. -60%.<br>
Puppet Only: You may possess your own Puppets automatically, but you cannot possess anyone else. -30%.<br>
Spiritual: You must have the Spirit meta-trait (p. 263) to take this limitation. Your spirit body merges with and occupies the body of your host. It remains insubstantial during the possession, traveling inside the host but otherwise inaccessible to you and effectively mindless. It can be injured as detailed under Parasitic, but only by attacks that affect insubstantial things. A genuine exorcist can cast you out by winning a Quick Contest of his exorcism ability vs. your Will. You cannot return to a body you have been cast out of for at least 24 hours. You may choose to release your host at any time. If you are exorcised or leave voluntarily, the host recovers after 1d seconds of mental stun. -20%.<br>
Telepathic: Your ability is part of the Telepathy psi power (see p. 257). -10%.<br>
Specialized: You can only possess certain hosts. The default is anything alive. All Carbon-Based Life is -10%; All Earthly Life is -20%; Animals Only is -25%; All Mammals, All Reptiles, etc., is -30%; and Dogs Only, Humans Only, Martians Only, etc., is -40%.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>POWER INVESTITURE</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>10 points/level</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>A deity - god, demon lord, great spirit, cosmic power, etc. - has empowered you to cast clerical spells. Add your Power Investiture to your IQ when you learn spells granted by the deity who bestowed this advantage. For instance, IQ 12 and Power Investiture 2 (Thor) would let you learn spells granted by the god Thor (and only Thor) as if you had IQ 14.<br>
You may only learn clerical spells from a fixed list set by your deity, who may even dictate which specific spells you learn. The GM determines this list and takes on the role of your deity when you wish to learn new spells. However, because you are channeling divine will as opposed to studying magic, clerical spells do not have prerequisites.<br>
In general, the more Power Investiture you have, the holier you are. The maximum level of Power Investiture depends on your deity, as determined by the GM. Minor deities who have a limited ability to transfer power to their chosen, or a small range of possible spell effects, might grant only one level, while major deities might be more generous.<br>
Note that Power Investiture is a measure of your bond with your deity, while Clerical Investment (p. 43) and Religious Rank (p. 30) measure social power. These need not be related. Power Investiture might be restricted to high-ranking clerics . . . but a deity can grant power to anyone it wants (possibly to the chagrin of the church!).<br>
In some cases, you can add or increase Power Investiture in play. What this entails depends on the deity. To gain, keep, or improve Power Investiture, you nearly always have to take and adhere to one or more of the traits listed under Self-Imposed Mental Disadvantages (p. 121). If you break these vows, you will lose some or all of your powers - perhaps until you have made proper penance, perhaps permanently. In effect, Power Investiture comes with a built-in Pact limitation (see p. 113); do not apply this modifier again.<br>
You may also need to meet certain physical requirements. Some deities only empower men, women, eunuchs, virgins . . . the GM should be creative. Should you lose a special requirement (such as virginity), your Power Investiture may be diminished or lost, reducing your point value accordingly.<br>
You can have both Magery and Power Investiture (unless your deity forbids this), but Magery does not improve clerical spells and Power Investiture does not aid magical spells. The clerical and magical versions of a given spell are entirely different spells, and clerical spells never count as prerequisites for magical spells. If you know both versions of a spell, they do not affect one another.<br>
Power Investiture is one possible way to handle holy powers. It is most appropriate in settings where priests are divinely inspired wizards. For other views of divine gifts, see Blessed (p. 40) and True Faith (p. 94).</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>PRECOGNITION</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>25 points</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You receive glimpses of future events. You cannot control the content of these flashes - you just know that something interesting or important might happen, at some unspecified future date. You might learn this through visions, voices, or sudden knowledge. A vivid premonition of a terrible event might even require a Fright Check (p. 360)!<br>
Precognition only gives information that your future self could learn and that would matter to you. For instance, if you're in New York, you are unlikely to have a premonition about a random murder in Los Angeles. But if the victim was a friend, or if the killing was important enough to make national news, you might flash on it.<br>
Nothing about the future is certain, though. Even if the GM has made up his mind, he could reconsider . . . although something related to the premonition should still happen. In most settings, predicted events will occur unless you take specific action to prevent them. (But the GM is free to rule that the future is immutable in his setting!)<br>
Whenever the GM feels a premonition would be appropriate, he will secretly make an IQ roll for you - usually during an encounter with a person or object. For instance, meeting someone with an important event in his future might set off a premonition related to that event, especially if it would affect you in some way. Similarly, seeing a picture of a place could set off a vision involving that location.<br>
A deliberate attempt to use Precognition requires 10 minutes of concentration, 2 FP, and an IQ roll at -8. You can attempt to read your own future, or that of another person. To deliberately read the future of someone else, you must be able to touch him.<br>
Precognition is normally limited to seeing into the near future - perhaps a week or so. At the GM's option, however, a critical success or a very important event might result in visions from much further in the future.<br>
Note that Precognition includes Danger Sense (p. 47) - do not take both.<br>
Directed: When you deliberately use your ability, you may opt to focus on a specific event involving the subject of your attempt (yourself or someone else). Name the event - e.g., The battle with the Dark Lord - before you roll. On a success, you discover the most likely outcome. Failure means you learn nothing, and critical failure blacks out the event in all future premonitions. Passive use is unchanged. Directed is mutually exclusive with One Event. +100%.<br>
<hr>
</p><h3 class="card">Special Limitations</h3><p class="card">
Can't See Own Death: Your Precognition cannot detect people or events that the GM believes have a high probability of causing your death. Your ability does not include Danger Sense. -60%.<br>
ESP: Your ability is part of the ESP psi power (see p. 255). -10%.<br>
One Event: Your ability works only for a particular type of event: events involving you personally (if you scanned another, you would only see a significant event if you were involved); disasters; events related to death; events related to love, etc. This limitation is mutually exclusive with Can't See Own Death. -40%.<br>
Active Only: You can only use your gift deliberately - you never receive spontaneous visions. Your ability doesn't include Danger Sense. This is mutually exclusive with Can't See Own Death. -60%.<br>
Passive Only: You can never use your gift deliberately. This is mutually exclusive with Active Only and Directed. -20%.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>PRESSURE SUPPORT</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>5 to 15 points</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>Every character has a native pressure. For ordinary humans, this is the pressure of Earth's atmosphere (1 atmosphere). A native pressure other than 1 atmosphere is a 0-point feature, but if you can survive for a prolonged period of time at a wide range of pressures, you have an advantage. This trait comes in three levels:<br>
Pressure Support 1: You can survive at pressures between your native pressure and 10 times that. (This would enable a human to survive on most of Earth's continental shelves.) 5 points.<br>
Pressure Support 2: You can withstand pressures between your native pressure and 100 times that. (This would enable a human to survive anywhere in Earth's oceans, save the deepest trenches.) 10 points.<br>
Pressure Support 3: You are immune to the effects of high pressure. 15 points.<br>
Pressure Support lets your body stay at a constant internal pressure with respect to a constant and uniform external pressure. This protects against attacks that manipulate ambient pressure or crush the entire body, but provides no defense against localized or transient pressure changes. In particular, Pressure Support does not reduce or prevent damage from crushing attacks or explosions of any kind.<br>
Those with Pressure Support often have the Sealed advantage (p. 82), but this is not required.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>PROTECTED SENSE</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>5 points/sense</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>One of your ranged senses is protected against overload. It rapidly adapts to the most intense of stimuli, allowing you to function normally after a maximum of two seconds of impairment. You will never suffer permanent damage to that sense as a result of excessive sensory input, and you get +5 to rolls to resist temporary damage and Sense-Based attacks targeting that sense.<br>
Protected Senses cost 5 points apiece. Protected Vision resists glare and eye damage from lasers, and lets Dark Vision, Infravision, and Night Vision adjust instantly from bright light to darkness. Protected Hearing protects against loud noises. Protected Taste/Smell filters out strong odors and tastes (but not toxins). The GM may permit other Protected Senses (Detect, Scanning Sense, etc.), with suitable justification.</p,></div></div>

<div><p class='card'>You are a psionic null. Psionic abilities cannot directly affect you or anything you are carrying or wearing. For instance, a telekinetic could throw a rock at you, but he could not levitate you or grab a sword from your hand.<br>
<hr>
</p><h3 class="card">Special Enhancements</h3><p class="card">
Area Effect: You emit static in an area centered on you. The first level of Area Effect extends your static to everything within one yard. Each level after the first doubles this radius as usual; see Area Effect (p. 102). +50%/level.<br>
Switchable: You can switch this advantage off in order to allow friendly psis to affect you or operate within your area of effect. +100%.  <br>
<hr>
</p><h3 class="card">Special Limitations</h3><p class="card">
Resistible: Your ability is not absolute. A psi can burn through your static and affect those protected by it by winning a Quick Contest of Will with you. If the attacking psi ability already requires a Quick Contest, the attacker rolls only once but the target gets +5 to resist. -50%.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>PSYCHOMETRY</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>20 points</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You can sense the history of a place or inanimate object - its use, its user's personality, etc. This is usually a supernatural gift of some sort (such as psi), but it could also represent a technological time-scanning power that can see the past.<br>
To use Psychometry, you must touch the subject item or location, concentrate for one second, and make an IQ roll. This roll is at no penalty for an event that occurred the same day, -1 for one that occurred up to 10 days ago, -2 if up to 100 days ago, -3 if up to 3 years ago, -4 if up to 30 years ago, -5 if up to 300 years ago, and so on. At the GM's option, you might notice very strong vibes on an IQ-4 roll, even if you aren't concentrating.<br>
On a success, you receive the general sense of emotions and events tied to the object or place . . . if it is linked to emotionally charged events (an uneventful history might leave no impressions at all). This is not always a good thing - a terrifying impression might require a Fright Check (p. 360)! On a critical success, you experience an actual vision. No matter how well you roll, you cannot detect magic, spirits, etc. Still, a magic item, ghostly haunt, or ritual site is likely to have an emotionally charged history, giving strong impressions.<br>
On a failure, you receive no impressions at all, and cannot attempt to read that object or place again for 24 hours.<br>
Directed: You can focus on specific events in the past. State what you're searching for before you roll. Success means you glean information pertinent to the event of interest instead of receiving a general flood of emotions. Failure means you learn nothing. On a critical failure, you're permanently blinded to that piece of history. +50%.<br>
Immersive: A successful use of your ability gives you an actual replay of emotionally charged events, similar to the vision that those without this enhancement experience on a critical success. If scanning a place, you see and hear things as if you were standing at that location during the events of interest. If reading an object, you witness events from the object's point of view. This enhancement can shortcircuit mystery adventures - handle with care! +100%.<br>
Sensitive: You can read uneventful history as well as emotionally charged events. For instance, you might learn who made a dagger, how often it was sharpened, and where it was stored when it wasn't stabbing people. +30%.<br>
<hr>
</p><h3 class="card">Special Limitations</h3><p class="card">
ESP: Your ability is part of the ESP psi power (see p. 255). -10%.<br>
Active Only: You can only use your ability deliberately. You never receive spontaneous visions, no matter how strong the vibes. -20%.<br>
Hypersensory: You reconstruct past events from minute pieces of evidence spotted by your mundane senses. You're not consciously aware of these clues, but taken together, they give you a general idea of what happened here. This gift relies on your senses, and you roll at -3 if you can't use one of smell, touch, or vision. If you can't use two of these senses, roll at -6. If all three are blocked - or if the GM rules that there are no clues to be found - your ability doesn't work. Hypersensory includes Mundane (don't take both), and is mutually exclusive with Immersive and Sensitive. -50%.<br>
Mundane: Your ability detects temporal echoes of the past - not the emotional charge on objects or locations. You can only read uneventful history, as described for Sensitive (don't take both). -30%.<br>
Passive Only: You possess only the capacity to notice strong impressions on an IQ-4 roll. You can never use your gift deliberately. This is mutually exclusive with Directed, Sensitive, and all three of the special limitations above. -60%.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>PUPPET</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>5 or 10 points</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>Prerequisites: Possession and either Ally or Dependent.<br>
A Puppet is an Ally (p. 36) or Dependent (p. 131) who cannot resist your Possession advantage (p. 75). When you use Possession on him, you succeed automatically! This may be due to his nature or some special knowledge you have: a curse, his true name, the key to his mind, etc.<br>
A Puppet will always have IQ 0, or owe you a Duty (p. 133), or be Reprogrammable (p. 150). If he has a Duty, it must be Involuntary, and its frequency must be identical to the Puppet's own frequency of appearance as an Ally or Dependent.<br>
Each Puppet costs 5 points. You can buy an entire group of related Allies as Puppets for 10 points. These costs are for the Puppet advantage only; you must pay for your Ally or Dependent separately. It is common but not mandatory for such Allies to have the Minion enhancement or the Unwilling limitation.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>RACIAL MEMORY</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>15 or 40 points</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You have access to the memories of your direct ancestors (or earlier software generations, for Digital Minds). This ability comes in two forms:<br>
Racial Memory (Passive): Your talent is vague and totally passive. The GM secretly makes an IQ roll for you in any situation that your ancestors might have encountered. On a success, you get a feeling of deja vu about the situation. It is up to you to interpret this. A critical success gives a vivid replay of ancient ancestral memories. On a failure, nothing happens. A critical failure results in a wrong impression. 15 points.<br>
Racial Memory (Active): You may use this advantage actively. If you want to know something, the GM first determines whether or not your ancestors knew the answer. Then he rolls against your IQ to see if you can gain access to the information. If your ancestors didn't have the answer and the roll succeeds, you will know that. On a critical failure, you will believe your ancestors didn't know, even if they really did. This requires one turn of absolute concentration (the GM may require more elaborate preparations to recall very ancient memories). 40 points.<br>
Immersive: Successful use of your ability gives you a replay of ancestral memories, similar to what those without this enhancement experience on a critical success. On Racial Memory (Passive), this removes the need for interpretation when you receive a vision. With Racial Memory (Active), you can replay your ancestors' lives at will! +50%.</p,></div></div>

<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>RANK</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>5 or 10 points/level</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>Specific sectors of society – e.g., the civil service, the military, and certain powerful religions – often have internal ranking systems, distinct from Status. If an organization like this has significant social influence, or access to useful resources, then its members must pay points for their rank within the organization.<br>
Rank comes in levels. Each Rank has authority over those of lower Rank – regardless of personal ability. In most cases, there are six to eight levels of Rank. The GM should determine the highest Rank available to starting characters, usually Rank 3-5. <br>
Unlike Status, Rank costs no money to maintain. On the other hand, almost all forms of Rank come with a Duty (see p.133). Rank often has stringent prerequisites, too – typically one of the traits given under Privilege (p.30) or a minimum skill level. These things have their own point costs, not included in the cost of the Rank. In a given society, there are usually severalsystems of Rank; the precise varieties depend on the game world.<br>
In most cases, you may hold more than one kind of Rank, although the GM is free to rule that holding one sort of Rank precludes holding another.<br>
Rank may coexist with Status. If so, then high Rank grants additional Status at no extra cost: +1 to Status at Rank 2-4, +2 to Status at Rank 5-7, and +3 to Status at Rank 8 or higher. This represents society’s respect for senior members of important social institutions. If you hold multiple types of Rank, then you may claim a Status bonus for each of them. <br>
Alternatively, one form of Rank might replace Status; for instance, Religious Rank in a theocracy. In societies like this, Status does not exist. Each level of Rank gives all its usual benefits plus the effect of an equivalent level of Status.<br>
Rank is worth 5 points per level if it coexists with Status, or 10 points per level if it replaces Status. Common varieties of Rank include:<br>
Administrative Rank: Position within a governmental bureaucracy. When dealing with other administrators, differences in Rank work just like differences in Status (see p.28). At TL5 and higher, a large bureaucracy might haveseveral varieties of Rank: one per government department, and possibly extra categories for the senate, judiciary, etc. (Defense or law-enforcement officials use Military or Police Rank instead.) Note this on your character sheet; e.g., Administrative Rank (Judiciary). <br>
Merchant Rank: Position within a national or transnational organization of merchants. This could be anything from the mercantile culture of the Aztecs (where Merchant Rank verged on being Status) to the “merchant marine” of a modern or futuristic society (where Merchant Rank often parallels Military Rank during wartime).<br>
Military Rank: Position within a military organization. Each organization is structured differently. In general, personnel that are not specifically leaders will be Rank 0-2, while lowlevel officers and senior enlisted men will be Rank 3-4. Rank 5 and higher is normally limited to major commands and duties where the officer is responsible for extremely valuable or rare resources. Limited-duty officers, specialists, and personnel with littleactualresponsibility or command authority have a lower Rank in GURPS terms, despite possibly possessing titles identical to those of a higher Rank; represent this with one or more levels of Courtesy Rank (see Courtesy Rank, p. 29).<br>
Police Rank:Position in a police force. Each agency has its own variety of Rank. You must buy Legal Enforcement Powers (p.65) before you can buy Police Rank; this is the difference between a patrol officer (Police Rank 0, for 0 points) and an ordinary citizen (no Police Rank, also 0 points). Note that in a police state, there is no difference between Police Rank and Military Rank.<br>
Religious Rank:Position in a religious hierarchy. Each religion has its own variety of Rank. You must buy Clerical Investment (p.43) before you can buy Religious Rank; this is the difference between a novice (Religious Rank 0, for 0 points) and a layperson (no Religious Rank, also 0 points). Other common requirements include a minimum level of Theology skill and being of a particular sex or race. Differences in Rank work just like differences in Status (see p.28) when dealing with co-religionists and those who respect your faith.<br>
<hr>
Temporary Rank: Those of higher Rank may temporarily increase your Rank for a predetermined amount of time – until the end of a project, battle, etc. This process is called brevetting in the case of Military Rank. To keep temporary Rank, you must meet all the usual requirements and pay the appropriate point cost.<br>
Courtesy Rank: Those who have formerly held Rank may retain that Rank as “Courtesy Rank” for only 1 point per level. Those who currently hold a title that carries little real authority may also take Courtesy Rank. Courtesy Rank is for social situations only; it gives you a fancier title.<br>
Rank for Spies: Officers of national intelligence services often possess a special category of Military Rank, distinct from that of line soldiers. Employees of civilian intelligence agencies usually possess some variety of Administrative Rank instead. Finally, some counterintelligence officers are actually police, and hold Police Rank. Those playing spies should consult with the GM before purchasing Rank of any kind!</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>RAPID HEALING</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>5 or 15 points</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>Your wounds heal quickly. This trait comes in two levels:<br>
Rapid Healing: Whenever you roll to recover lost HP or to see if you can get over a crippling injury, you get +5 to your effective HT. Prerequisite: HT 10+. 5 points.<br>
Very Rapid Healing: As above, but when you roll to recover lost HT, a successful HT roll means you heal two HP, not one. Prerequisite: HT 12+. 15 points.<br>
Note that this advantage does not hasten recovery from the short-term effects of injury, such as stunning and knockout; get Recovery (p. 80) for that.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>RAPIER WIT</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>5 points</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You can use witty repartee to stun your foes in combat. This does not require a combat maneuver - talking is a free action (p. 363). Roll a Quick Contest of Public Speaking skill vs. your opponent's Will.<br>
Modifiers: -2 if your target has the Clueless or No Sense of Humor disadvantage; any modifier the GM assigns based on your description of the verbal attack; -1 per opponent beyond the first to affect a group (and you must know something the entire group has in common; e.g., they're all flunkies of the same household or members of the same military unit). Opponents with the Unfazeable advantage (p. 95) are immune to Rapier Wit.<br>
If you win, your opponent is mentally stunned (see p. 420). A critical success causes one HP of physical damage as well - your victim injures himself accidentally (drops something on his foot, chokes on his own tongue, etc.). If you lose, there is no effect. On a critical failure, you enrage your opponent, possibly triggering such disadvantages as Berserk and Bloodlust!<br>
This advantage is usually only appropriate in a silly campaign!<br>
Words of Power: You faze opponents with the supernatural might inherent in your words or voice. Perhaps you know magic words from the dawn of creation - or speak with the voice of the gods! Language is no barrier, and you can affect those who have the Unfazeable advantage. To use your ability, roll a Quick Contest of Will with your opponent, ignoring modifiers for Clueless and No Sense of Humor. Standard penalties apply if trying to affect a group. +100%.</p,></div></div>

<div><p class='card'>You can remember skills (spells, techniques, etc.) learned during previous lives. You must purchase these abilities normally; Reawakened is just a special Unusual Background (p. 96) that explains how you learned them without a teacher. This trait is only available if reincarnation is a fact in the setting (GM's decision).</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>RECOVERY</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>10 points</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You recover from unconsciousness very quickly. When determining the length of time you remain unconscious for any reason, divide by all times by 60: hours become minutes, minutes become seconds . . . even a month-long coma becomes a mere 12- hour sleep.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>REDUCED CONSUMPTION</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>2 points/level</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You can go for a long time without food and water, or fuel - although you still require these things. (For indefinite endurance, see Doesn't Eat or Drink, p. 50.) This advantage comes in four levels:<br>
Reduced Consumption 1: You require 2/3 as much food and water, or fuel, as usual (two meals a day). 2 points.<br>
Reduced Consumption 2: You require 1/3 as much food and water, or fuel, as usual (one meal a day). 4 points.<br>
Reduced Consumption 3: You require food and water only once per week (one meal a week, or about 5% as much). 6 points.<br>
Reduced Consumption 4: You require food and water only once per month (one meal a month, or about 1% as much). 8 points.<br>
Note that one or even two levels of this advantage might be appropriate for ascetics in cinematic games!<br>
Cast-Iron Stomach: You require the standard amount of food and water, but the quality is irrelevant. You can eat rotten vegetables and fuzzy bluegreen meat, and drink dishwater and sour milk. Instead of reducing how often you must eat, reduce your demands on life support (and your food costs) by a like amount: to 2/3 normal at level 1, 1/3 normal at level 2, 5% normal at level 3, and 1% normal at level 4. You get a bonus equal to your level (+1 to +4) to resist the effects of food-borne poisons or diseases not tailored expressly for you, but -3 on reactions from anyone watching you eat! -50%.<br>
Food Only: You require less food, but the usual amount of water. -50%.<br>
Water Only: You require less water, but the usual amount of food. -50%.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>REGENERATION</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>Variable</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>Your wounds heal in mere hours, minutes, or seconds! To regenerate lost limbs, you will also need Regrowth (below) - but Regeneration will greatly accelerate that ability. Regeneration includes Rapid Healing (p. 79) at no extra cost.<br>
You cannot have Regeneration if you have Slow Healing (p. 155) or Unhealing (p. 160). Regeneration is compatible with Draining (p. 132), but it does not restore the daily HP loss due to that disadvantage.<br>
The cost of this trait depends on your regeneration speed:<br>
Regeneration (Slow): You recover 1 HP every 12 hours, in addition to normal healing. 10 points.<br>
Regeneration (Regular): You recover 1 HP per hour. 25 points.<br>
Regeneration (Fast): You recover 1 HP per minute. 50 points.<br>
Regeneration (Very Fast): You recover 1 HP per second. 100 points.<br>
Regeneration (Extreme): You recover 10 HP per second. 150 points.<br>
<hr>
</p><h3 class="card">Special Enhancements</h3><p class="card">
Heals Radiation: You shed accumulated rads at 10 times the rate at which you heal missing HP. For instance, Regeneration (Regular) removes 10 rads per hour. This will heal permanent radiation damage. +40%.<br>
Fatigue Recovery: Only for Fast or better Regeneration. You regain lost FP at the same rate as you recover HP. +100%.<br>
<hr>
</p><h3 class="card">Special Limitations</h3><p class="card">
Radiation Only: As Heals Radiation, but you only shed rads - you do not heal HP. -60%.<br>
Fatigue Only: Your ability only aids FP recovery, as described for Fatigue Recovery. It has no effect on injury, and doesn't include Rapid Healing. -0%.<br>
Limited: Your Regeneration accelerates an advantage, usually without restoring HP. It doesn't include Rapid Healing. DR Only speeds the recovery of DR lost as a result of corrosion, the Ablative limitation, etc. Regrowth Only repairs limbs, not HP. Find the normal recovery time in days and divide by 3 if Slow; read days as hours, minutes, or seconds if Regular, Fast, or Very Fast; or use the Very Fast time divided by 10 if Extreme. Unkillable Only does heal HP, but only after you die - and it stops working at positive HP (Unkillable 2) or full HP (Unkillable 3). -40%.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>REGROWTH</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>40 points</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You can regrow lost limbs and organs! A lost ear, finger, toe, claw, tentacle tip, etc. regrows in 1d weeks; a lost hand or foot in 1d+1 months; and a lost eye, arm, or leg in 2d+2 months. If you also have Regeneration (above), Regrowth works much faster: all lost body parts regrow in the time it takes you to heal to full HP.<br>
Doubling: When you lose a body part, you can sprout two replacements, like the Hydra of myth! You must have enough unspent points to buy the relevant advantage (Extra Arm, Extra Head, etc.), and you must pay these points as soon as you lose the body part. Otherwise, you can only grow a single replacement. Regrowth occurs at the usual speed. +25% if this works with only one type of body part (arms, legs, heads, etc.); +50% if it works with any missing part.<br>
Reattachment: You can reattach any severed but intact body part by holding it in place for a minute. Regeneration reduces this to 30 seconds if Slow, three seconds if Regular, or one second if Fast or better (but Very Fast and Extreme typically remove the need for this enhancement). +50%.<br>
<hr>
</p><h3 class="card">Special Limitations</h3><p class="card">
Minor: You can only regrow ears, fingers, toes, and other small bits - not hands, feet, eyes, etc. -50%.<br>
Bane: You can't regrow a body part if it's lost to injury from a particular source or if the stump is exposed to a specific substance (e.g., fire) - your choice. Limitation value depends on the rarity of the attack: -10% if Rare, -30% if Occasional, or -50% if Common or Very Common.<br>
Reattachment Only: You can only reattach body parts, as described for Reattachment, making your ability useless if the part is mangled, vaporized, eaten, etc. -50%.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>REPUTATION</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>'&lt;/font&gt;</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'> style=text-align:right;  &lt;font size=3&gt;'Varies'<br>
It is possible to be so well-known that your reputation becomes an advantage or a disadvantage. This affects reaction rolls made by NPCs (see p. 494). A reputation has four elements: Details, Reaction Modifier, People Affected, and Frequency of Recognition.<br>
<hr>
Details<br>
The details of your reputation are entirely up to you; you can be known for bravery, ferocity, eating green snakes, or whatever you want. However, you must give specifics. Reputation is, by definition, something noteworthy; there is no such thing as a “generic” reputation.<br>
<hr>
Reaction Modifier<br>
Specify the reaction-roll modifier that you get from people who recognize you. This determines the base cost of your reputation. For every +1 bonus to reaction rolls (up to +4), the cost is 5 points. For every -1 penalty (up to -4), the cost is -5 points.<br>
<hr>
People Affected<br>
The size of the group of people who might have heard of you modifies the base cost:<br>
Almost everyone in your game world (but not those from other universes – at least, not until they have met you!): x1.<br>
Almost everyone in your game world except one large class (everyone but the French, everyone but Elves, everyone but offworld visitors): x2/3 (round down).<br>
Large class of people (all people of a particular faith, all mercenaries, all tradesmen, etc.): x1/2 (round down). Small class of people (all priests of Wazoo, all literate people in 12th-century England, all mages in modern Alabama): x1/3 (round down).<br>
If the class of people affected is so small that, in the GM's opinion, you would not meet even one in the average adventure, your reputation isn't worth points. This depends on the setting; for instance, mercenary soldiers are rare in some game worlds, common in others.<br>
<hr>
Frequency Of Recognition<br>
Either your name or your face is enough to trigger a “reputation roll” to see if the people you meet have heard of you. Roll once for each person or small group you meet. For a large group, the GM may roll more than once if he likes. The frequency with which you are recognized modifies the cost of your reputation:<br>
All the time: x1.<br>
Sometimes (roll of 10 or less): x1/2 (round down).<br>
Occasionally (roll of 7 or less): x1/3 (round down).<br>
Of course, your reputation extends only within a certain area. If you travel far enough away, the GM may require you to “buy off” the disadvantage points you received for a bad reputation. (There is no corresponding bonus for losing a good reputation.)<br>
<hr>
Multiple Reputations<br>
You may have more than one reputation, and your reputations can overlap. The GM should check each one before determining how an NPC reacts to you. Your total reaction modifier from reputations cannot be better than +4 or worse than -4 in a given situation.<br>
<hr>
Multifaceted Reputations<br>
A single reputation can give different reaction modifiers with different groups, provided the groups do not overlap. Set the reaction modifier for each group, modify the cost for the size of the group, and then add up the resulting costs. Modify this total for frequency of recognition. The reputation is an advantage if the net point cost is positive, a disadvantage if negative. The final point cost may be 0, but you should still record it on your character sheet!<br>
Example 1: Sir Anacreon has a reputation for fearless monster-slaying. This earns him a +2 reaction from those who recognize him. Everyone has heard of him (no modifier), and he is recognized on a roll of 10 or less (x1/2). He has a 5-point advantage.<br>
Example 2: The Green Dragon has a reputation as a crimefighter. He gets +3 reactions from honest citizens – which is almost everyone except the large class of dishonest citizens (x2/3) – for 10 points. He receives a -4 reaction from the underworld – a large group (x1/2) – for -10 points. The net point cost for his reputation is 0 points. If his player wished, he could specify a frequency of recognition, but the final cost would still be 0 points.<br>

<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>RESISTANT</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>Variable</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You are naturally resistant (or even immune) to noxious items or substances that are not direct, physical attacks. This gives you a bonus on all HT rolls to resist incapacitation or injury from such things.<br>
The bonus from Resistant applies to all rolls to resist noxious effects within a particular category - usually some combination of disease, poison, and environmental syndromes (altitude sickness, the bends, space sickness, etc.). It also applies to rolls to resist attacks that use these effects. This includes Afflictions with one of Blood Agent, Contact Agent, Follow- Up, or Respiratory Agent, and Innate Attacks that have such modifiers and inflict toxic or fatigue damage.<br>
Resistant does not protect against effects that Damage Resistance or Protected Sense either stop or provide a HT bonus to resist. This includes Afflictions and Innate Attacks that do not have any of the modifiers given above.<br>
The base cost for Resistant depends on the rarity of the effects it counteracts:<br>
Very Common: A broad category within the noxious items described above. Example: Metabolic Hazards (all threats that only affect the living, including all disease and poison, plus such syndromes as altitude sickness, bends, seasickness, and jet lag). 30 points.<br>
Common: A group of related items encountered as often in nature as in an attack, or some other suitably broad subset of Very Common. Example: Poison (all toxins, but not asphyxiants or corrosives) or Sickness (all diseases and environmental syndromes). 15 points.<br>
Occasional: A group of closely related items more often encountered in nature than as a deliberate attack, or a subset of a Common group. Examples: Disease (all bacteria, viruses, fungus infections, etc.) or Ingested Poison. 10 points.<br>
Rare: A specific item or environmental syndrome, or a subset of an Occasional group. Examples: Acceleration (blackouts due to extreme G-forces), Altitude Sickness, Bends (decompression sickness), Seasickness, or Space Sickness; Nanomachines. 5 points.<br>
Multiply base cost to reflect your degree of resistance:<br>
You are totally immune to all noxious effects, and never have to make resistance rolls (write this as Immunity on your character sheet): x1.<br>
You have +8 to all HT rolls to resist: x1/2.<br>
You have +3 to all HT rolls to resist: x1/3.<br>
Drop all fractions from the final cost.<br>
An ordinary human could believably have any level of resistance to a mundane Rare item, such as Seasickness. He might also have Resistant to Disease (+3) [3], Resistant to Disease (+8) [5], or Resistant to Poison (+3) [5]. Anything more would be superhuman. Golems, robots, undead, and other beings that are not truly alive must take Immunity to Metabolic Hazards [30]; this is already included in the Machine meta-trait (p. 263). When in doubt, the GM's word is final.<br>
Mental Resistance: It is possible to be Resistant to a purely mental threat. This works as described above, except that the bonus applies to resistance rolls against IQ and Will instead of HT. Psionics is an allowed category, and is considered Very Common.</p,></div></div>

<div><p class='card'>You are totally clean. Your body produces minimal, sanitized waste products, and you never suffer from bad breath, excessive perspiration, or unsightly skin problems. This gives -1 to attempts to track you by scent and +1 to reaction rolls in close confines (cramped spaceships, submarines, elevators, etc.).</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>SCANNING SENSE</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>Variable</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You can emit energy, bounce it off objects, and analyze the returned signal to build up a picture of your surroundings. This lets you discern size and shape, but not color or fine detail (such as writing). It has nothing to do with the normal human sense of sight, and requires no light. As a result, you may ignore darkness penalties in combat. Perception is limited to a 120° arc in front of you.<br>
Your sense is active. Anyone who can sense the signal you emit can detect you, out to twice your own range. Unlike other sensory advantages, however, you can turn this ability off; see Turning Advantages Off and On (p. 34).<br>
Below are several varieties of Scanning Sense. Each is a separate advantage, with its own special rules. Where these rules contradict the general ones given above, follow the special rules. Each sense also has a base range. To adjust this, take Increased Range (p. 106) or Reduced Range (p. 115).<br>
Radar: Your Scanning Sense uses radio waves. Base range is 2,000 yards. You can only detect large (humansized or larger), dense objects. On a Sense roll, you get a general idea of the relative size of the object, and whether it is moving, but nothing more precise. You cannot get an actual image with Radar, or use it to aim attacks. Radar works best on flying targets; roll at -4 to spot anyone who is not silhouetted against the sky. Radar does not work at all underwater. 20 points.<br>
Imaging Radar: Your Scanning Sense uses millimeter-wave radar. Base range is 200 yards. You can spot small objects and determine their shape, but you must make a Sense roll to distinguish fine relief (e.g., to identify a face). Imaging Radar can see through thin fabric or vegetation. You get +3 to locate objects like concealed weapons, and may ignore penalties for spotting objects hidden behind light brush. Ordinary radar detectors detect Imaging Radar at -4. Imaging Radar does not work underwater. 20 points.<br>
Ladar: Your Scanning Sense uses a laser beam. Base range is 200 yards. Ladar is very similar to Imaging Radar, but the beam is narrower and offers better resolution. This gives -4 on rolls to locate objects of interest, but +4 on rolls to identify them. Only specialized ladar detectors can detect Ladar, and at -4 even then. Ladar cannot penetrate dense smoke or solid objects. It has 10-50% range in falling rain or snow, and 1% range underwater. 20 points.<br>
Para-Radar: Your Scanning Sense uses energy unknown to 21st-century science. Treat Para-Radar as Imaging Radar, except that it functions in any environment! Ordinary radar detectors cannot detect Para-Radar, although some ultra-tech sensors might be able to do so. 40 points.<br>
Sonar: Your Scanning Sense uses ultrasonic sound waves. Base range is 2,000 yards underwater. You can spot small objects and determine their shape, but you must make a Sense roll to distinguish fine relief (e.g., to identify a face). Sonar does not function if you are deafened, and can be jammed or fooled by a very loud noise (e.g., an explosion). Individuals with Ultrahearing can detect Sonar. Sonar is much less effective in air: range is only 20 yards multiplied by air pressure in atmospheres (one atmosphere on Earth). Sonar is completely ineffective in vacuum. 20 points.<br>
Active IR: Your Scanning Sense uses an infrared (IR) beam. Base range is 200 yards. It can distinguish fine relief as well as the human eye; if someone using ordinary vision could identify details without a die roll, then so can you. Only IR detectors and those with Infravision (p. B60) can detect Active IR. You can switch off your beam in order to avoid detection, in which case this ability functions as Infravision (but when turned on, it can spot targets that don't emit heat). Active IR doesn't work underwater. 20 points.<br>
T-Ray Vision: Your Scanning Sense uses sub-millimeter-wave radar, bordering on the infrared. Base range is 200 yards. Like Imaging Radar, T-Ray Vision can spot small objects and determine their shape, and eliminates penalties to spot objects behind light cover. However, T-Ray Vision is more precise. It gets +4 to locate concealed weapons, and while it still requires a Sense roll to distinguish fine relief, this roll is also at +4. Only rare, special- purpose sensors can detect TRay Vision. T-Ray Vision doesn't work underwater. 25 points.<br>

</p><h3 class="card">Special Enhancements</h3><p class="card">
Extended Arc: You can scan an arc greater than 120°. A 240° arc (as described for Peripheral Vision, p. 74) is +75%; a 360° arc (as described for 360° Vision, p. 34) is +125%.<br>
Low-Probability Intercept (LPI): This is only available for Radar and Sonar. You can switch this enhancement on and off. Turning it on makes your signal difficult to detect. This halves range, but your Scanning Sense can only be detected at 1.5 times the halved range. +10%.<br>
Multi-Mode: This is only available for Radar. You can switch between Radar and Imaging Radar. (This is much cheaper than buying the two advantages separately, because they overlap to some extent.) +50%.<br>
Penetrating: This is only available for Para-Radar. You can see inside any object within range. This functions exactly as Penetrating Vision 2 (p. 74). +50%.<br>
Targeting: By taking an Aim maneuver, you can lock onto any object within range and determine its precise range and speed - just as if you had a high-tech rangefinder. This gives you +3 to hit that target with an aimed ranged attack. +20%.<br>
Bio-Scan: Para-Radar only. You receive vital signs and biochemical information from anything you scan - both the target itself and anything living on its surface. This lets you use skills like Biology and Diagnosis from a safe distance. With Penetrating, you can also examine living beings inside inanimate objects (e.g., the passengers of a car). +50%.<br>
No Intercept: Your Scanning Sense is completely undetectable. This highly unrealistic enhancement mainly suits psis and supers. +50%.<br>
Scanner: Para-Radar only. You receive detailed information about the composition, energy output, radiation emissions, etc. of anything you scan. This allows detailed analysis from a distance with scientific skills such as Chemistry and Physics. With Penetrating, you can spot specific systems within a complex machine and analyze them using Engineer skill. Sci-fi sensors typically have both enhancements - and often Bio-Scan, too. +50%.<br>

Targeting Only: As Targeting, but you can only use your sense to lock onto targets already spotted with another sense; you cannot use it to spot things. -40%.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>SEALED</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>15 points</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You are encased in a gas- and liquid- impermeable layer. This makes you waterproof, and grants complete immunity to corrosive or toxic agents that must touch skin or exposed machinery to work. You must still breathe, unless you also have Doesn't Breathe (p. 49); however, your exterior breathing apparatus (nose, snorkel, etc.) is protected by this trait. Likewise, you are not automatically pressurized; for that, take Pressure Support (p. 77) or Vacuum Support (p. 96).</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>SECURITY CLEARANCE</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>Variable</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>A government agency or corporation trusts you with access to sensitive information that would otherwise be off limits to someone of your Rank or Status. For instance, a general cleared for military secrets commensurate with his Military Rank would not have to buy Security Clearance separately, but a civilian with exactly the same level of access would have to pay points for the privilege.<br>
Point cost depends on your degree of access:<br>
* You have access to a relatively narrow range of secrets on a need to know basis. Example: a strategic bomber pilot, who might know secrets about aircraft, weapons, and targets. 5 points.<br>
* You have either free access to a narrow range of secrets or need to know access to a broad range of secrets. Example: a counterintelligence officer, who would have limited access to many secrets, as part of his job is to protect them. 10 points.<br>
* You have free access to a broad range of secrets. Example: a cinematic secret agent, who will know almost any secret the plot requires him to know. 15 points.<br>
Halve these values (round up) if the organization that grants the Security Clearance is of relatively minor importance (e.g., a small corporation or municipal government).<br>
You cannot receive a security clearance without a thorough background check. The GM is free to forbid this advantage to any PC who has a suspicious past (including such traits as Debt or Secret) or an unstable personality (for instance, Paranoia or Sadism).</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>SEE INVISIBLE</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>15 points</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You can see objects or individuals that are normally invisible. Buy this advantage separately for each kind of invisibility.<br>
True Sight: Your vision can penetrate all deceptions related to the type of invisibility you can foil, including camouflage, disguises, and illusions. For instance, True Sight would allow See Invisible (Magical) to defeat magical illusions and the Blur spell (p. B250) as easily as magical invisibility. +50%.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>SENSITIVE TOUCH</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>10 points</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>Your fingertips or equivalent organs are extremely sensitive, allowing you to sense residual heat in a chair, faint vibrations in the floor as someone approaches, etc. You get +4 (in addition to any Acute Touch bonuses) on any task that utilizes the sense of touch; e.g., a Forensics roll to note the similarities or differences between two pieces of fabric, or a Search roll to feel out tiny concealed objects.<br>
Stethoscopic: You can pick up sounds from the other side of a barrier, or from within an object, by feeling the vibrations they set up. Make a Touch roll to hear conversations through walls. Deafness is no obstacle, but soundproofing gives its usual penalties. +50%.<br>
Ultra-Fine: Your sense of touch lets you read print by feeling the outline of the ink. This works even in the dark or if blinded. You also can read computer screens by feeling tiny differences in heat or electric field strength; this requires a Touch roll at -5. +30%.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>SERENDIPITY</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>15 points/level</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You have the knack of being in the right place at the right time. Each level of this trait entitles you to one fortuitous but plausible coincidence per game session. The details are up to the GM. For instance, the GM might declare that one of the guards you need to talk your way past just happens to be your cousin, or that there is a sports car idling in front of the bank just as you run outside in pursuit of the fleeing bank robbers.<br>
From time to time, the GM may rule that a single implausible coincidence counts as some or all of your lucky breaks for a given session (e.g., the mechanic at the local garage has all the parts you need to complete your ultra-tech contragrav belt).<br>
You are free to suggest serendipitous occurrences to the GM, but he gets the final say. Should he reject all your suggestions but fail to work Serendipity into the game session, you will get your lucky breaks next game session.<br>
Wishing: You can consciously wish for fortuitous coincidences. These must be within the realm of what's plausible in the current situation. For instance, if you were in prison, you could wish for the jailer to drop his key . . . but you couldn't wish to be teleported home. The GM is free to forbid anything that would unbalance the game. Normal usage limits apply. +100% if you can grant wishes for yourself and others; +0% if you can aid others but not yourself.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>SHADOW FORM</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>50 points</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You can become a two-dimensional shadow. This lets you slip along walls and floors - and through the thinnest cracks (anything wide enough to fit your shoulders through) - at your usual ground Move. You can also defy gravity, creeping up walls and across ceilings at half Move.<br>
Physical attacks do half damage to you in this form. Energy attacks do normal damage, except for light-based attacks, which do 50% extra damage. Magic, psi, and other purely mental abilities affect you normally.<br>
You are subject to a few major restrictions while in this form. You cannot walk through three-dimensional space; you must slide along an object. Furthermore, you cannot perform any purely physical attacks or actions, and you cannot carry ordinary items or affect them in any way. You can use magic, psi, and similar abilities, however.<br>
If you cannot switch out of Shadow Form, Shadow Form is a disadvantage worth -20 points. This will make it difficult to interact with others! You may still add enhancements, but they will work like limitations, reducing the value of the disadvantage. For instance, a +50% enhancement would reduce the value of the disadvantage by 50%, to -10 points.<br>
<hr>
</p><h3 class="card">Special Enhancements</h3><p class="card">
Can Carry Objects: You may carry objects. They take Shadow Form when picked up and return to normal when put down. You still may not affect non-shadow objects. No encumbrance is +10%; Light, +20%; Medium, +50%; Heavy, +100%.<br>
3-D Movement: You can turn 90° to a surface and stand up in three-dimensional space - like a two-dimensional cutout - in order to bridge gaps or turn around. You can walk at your normal ground Move. All of the other drawbacks of Shadow Form remain. +20%.<br>
Light Insensitive: You're not made of actual shadow. Your body might even look like a projected photograph of a normal human. The only game effect is that you don't suffer 50% extra damage from light. +20%.<br>
Finite Thickness: You don't quite become two-dimensional. You're about as thick as a sheet of paper, and can't fit through microscopic cracks. Being physical, you take full damage from physical attacks - and because you're so thin, the wounding multiplier for cutting attacks is x2 instead of x1.5. You aren't a shadow, though; light-based attacks get no bonus damage (don't buy Light Insensitive separately). You still can't physically attack, and you can only drag objects around on your surface if you buy the Can Carry Objects enhancement. -50%.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>SHAPESHIFTING: ALTERNATE FORM</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>Variable</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You can physically change into one or more forms different from your native form. To shift between forms, you must concentrate for 10 seconds. To speed this up, add Reduced Time (p. 108).<br>
Fatigue, injury, crippling, and afflictions carry over between forms - although HP and FP losses scale in proportion to the HP and FP of the form. For instance, if you suffer 10 HP of damage and a broken leg in a form that has 20 HP, you will have 5 HP of damage and a broken leg when you switch to a form that has only 10 HP.<br>
If you are knocked out or killed, you immediately revert to your native form (which will also be unconscious or dead). In addition, you must specify a single, reasonably common external influence that can force you to return to your native form against your will. This should suit the advantage's origin: a Dispel Magic spell if your ability is magical, exorcism if a spirit power, strong magnetic fields if technological, etc.<br>
Shapeshifting comprises two different traits: Alternate Form and Morph.<br>
<hr>
Alternate Form<br>
Variable<br>
Like the werewolf of folklore, you can assume a specific form other than your own. This can be anything built with points: humanoid, animal, robot, etc. Create your alternate form as a racial template (p. 260); however, you can switch it on and off. This template need not be a stock template. For instance, if you wish to retain human intelligence in beast form, you could shift into a template that lacks the beast's low IQ (although this increases the template cost and hence the cost of Alternate Form). The GM is the final judge of what templates are allowed as Alternate Forms.<br>
While it is turned on, your Alternate Form's racial template replaces your native racial template. Apply its racial traits - attribute modifiers, racial advantages and disadvantages, etc. - instead of those of your native race. Personal traits (including all attribute levels, advantages, disadvantages, and skills bought over and above racial norms) remain intact, although your skill levels are affected by changes to the controlling attribute scores.<br>
If the Alternate Form's racial template has traits that conflict with your personal traits, the traits of your Alternate Form take precedence. For instance, if you become a dolphin with No Manipulators, you will temporarily lose personal advantages that affect your hands, such as High Manual Dexterity, while you are in dolphin form - and some skills (for instance, Lockpicking) will be relatively useless, although you do remember them.<br>
If you have a single Alternate Form, it costs 15 points for a racial template worth no more than your native racial template. A more powerful form costs 15 points plus 90% of the difference in cost between your native template and that of your Alternate Form.<br>
If you have multiple forms, pay full cost for the most expensive form. The less powerful Alternate Forms cost a flat 15 points apiece. Minimum cost per form is still 15 points.<br>
Example: Consider four racial templates: a -100-point cuddly critter, a 0-point human, an 80-point ravenous beast, and a 100-point troll. A human who can turn into a cuddly critter pays 15 points, as the cuddly critter template is worth less than his native template. A cuddly critter who can turn into a human pays 15 + (0.9 x 100) = 105 points, since the human racial template is worth 100 points more than his own. A human who can become a troll also pays 15 + (0.9 x 100) = 105 points. A human who can assume any of the other three templates would pay full cost for his most expensive form, the troll: 105 points. The ravenous beast and cuddly critter forms would cost the minimum 15 points apiece. Total cost would be 135 points.<br>
Were-Creatures: To create the classic were-creature, start by purchasing any trait that applies in both forms - Infectious Attack, Vulnerability (Silver), etc. - as a personal trait. Next, buy an animal template as an Alternate Form. Since most beast templates are worth 0 or fewer points, this will usually cost 15 points, but powerful creatures (e.g., bears and tigers) may cost more. If the beast form is savage, the template should include such traits as Berserk, Bestial, and Bloodlust. Finally, apply limitations such as Emergencies Only (p. 112), Unconscious Only (p. 115), and Uncontrollable (p. 116) to Alternate Form, as applicable. If you can only change during the full moon, add a -40% Trigger limitation (p. 115) as well.<br>
Shapeshifting Races: When creating an entire race that has Alternate Form, work out the details of Alternate Form last. Total the cost of all the race's traits other than Alternate Form, subtract this total from the cost of the template the race transforms into, and use the difference to calculate the cost of Alternate Form for the race. Add the cost of Alternate Form to that of the race's other abilities to determine final racial cost.<br>
Example: Forest Dwarves can turn into sapient bears. Excluding Alternate Form, the racial traits of Forest Dwarves total 25 points. The bear template is worth 125 points. The difference is 125 - 25 = 100 points. Thus, the cost of Alternate Form is 15 + (0.9 x 100) = 105 points. This makes the Forest Dwarf template worth 25 + 105 = 130 points.<br>
Elemental Supers: The ability to become flame, stone, water, and so on often shows up in the comics. Buy this as Alternate Form with the appropriate elemental meta-trait (p. B262) as the target racial template. The GM may even permit players to create custom meta-traits for new elements. Most elemental supers have Absorptive Change at the No encumbrance level (+5%) for their costume, plus Active Change (+20%) or Reduced Time 4 (+80%).<br>
Transforming Machines: Robots or vehicles that can become other robots or vehicles are a comic-book standby. This is a standard Alternate Form that switches one machine template for another. Add Active Change (+20%) for transformers that can keep moving while changing. There's no need for Absorptive Change if all passengers and cargo are within the machine's Payload (p. B74).<br>
Were-Creatures: Werewolves and similar beings use Alternate Form to assume an animal template. Weres who can control their beast form might choose to retain IQ and do away with bestial mental traits - but this significantly elevates template cost. Those who change involuntarily during the full moon have Uncontrollable Trigger (a dangerous ability that triggers under occasional circumstances, for -15%) and Unconscious Only (-20%), and often Minimum Duration, One Night (-10%). Reciprocal Rest (+30%) is common . . . the were-form appears rested and ready to rampage!<br>
Absorptive Change: Only for Alternate Form. You absorb worn and carried items into your Alternate Form. These reappear when you change back. Without this modifier, you must leave your equipment behind when you change, and worn items too small for your Alternate Form risk destruction. Cost depends on encumbrance level: +5% for None, +10% for Light, +15% for Medium, +20% for Heavy, or +25% for Extra- Heavy. The GM decides what's left behind if your encumbrance exceeds your capacity. Apply this modifier separately to each form that can absorb equipment.<br>
Active Change: Your transformation takes the usual amount of time, but you needn't concentrate during this time - you can move and act. You have the abilities of the form you're changing from until the transition is complete. (GMs who enjoy extra detail can average the forms' statistics, or even use a weighted average to reflect how far along the change has come.) +20%.<br>
Non-Reciprocal Damage: Only for Alternate Form. Injury you suffer in one form doesn't affect any of your other forms - although wounds only heal while you're in the form that sustained them, unless you also take Reciprocal Rest. +50%.<br>
Once On, Stays On: This is identical to the general modifier of the same name (see p. 109), but with a special rule for Alternate Form: it counts as a +50% modifier on the basic 15 points and raises the form-specific cost from 90% to 100% of the difference in template costs.<br>
Reciprocal Rest: Only for Alternate Form. Your dormant forms can rest while they're out of sight. Time spent dormant counts toward FP recovery and the sleep needs of that form. In conjunction with Non-Reciprocal Damage, these forms can even recover HP and recuperate from crippling injuries. This doesn't preclude dormant forms being aware of and remembering the active form's actions. +30%.<br>

</p><h3 class="card">Special Limitations</h3><p class="card">
Cosmetic: You can only change your outward appearance. Your abilities and racial template are unaffected. -50%. This limitation includes Mass Conservation, but not Retains Shape.<br>
Projected Form: Only for Alternate Form. Your Alternate Form is a separate entity - perhaps a physical manifestation of your soul. When you use your ability, your native form falls into a trance and your Alternate Form appears nearby (within 10 yards). This is a real, physical form with no special restrictions on its actions. To dismiss it and awaken, it must be within 10 yards of your native form. If either form is wounded or killed, so is the other form; see Projection (p. 44) for details. -50%</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>SHAPESHIFTING: MORPH</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>Variable</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You can physically change into one or more forms different from your native form. To shift between forms, you must concentrate for 10 seconds. To speed this up, add Reduced Time (p. 108).<br>
Fatigue, injury, crippling, and afflictions carry over between forms - although HP and FP losses scale in proportion to the HP and FP of the form. For instance, if you suffer 10 HP of damage and a broken leg in a form that has 20 HP, you will have 5 HP of damage and a broken leg when you switch to a form that has only 10 HP.<br>
If you are knocked out or killed, you immediately revert to your native form (which will also be unconscious or dead). In addition, you must specify a single, reasonably common external influence that can force you to return to your native form against your will. This should suit the advantage's origin: a Dispel Magic spell if your ability is magical, exorcism if a spirit power, strong magnetic fields if technological, etc.<br>
Shapeshifting comprises two different traits: Alternate Form and Morph.<br>
<hr>
Morph<br>
Variable<br>
This ability is similar to Alternate Form, but not limited to specific racial templates. You can assume any racial template, within certain limits.<br>
First, the racial template must already exist in your game world. The GM might design the template himself or take one from a GURPS worldbook, but you cannot design totally new templates for the purpose of Morph (you can adjust existing ones, though; see below).<br>
Second, you can only turn into a living being, or a formerly living being such as a vampire. To change into a machine requires a special enhancement.<br>
Finally, the template's point value must be within a limit determined by the number of points you have in Morph.<br>
If you can assume any racial template worth no more than your native one, Morph costs 100 points. This makes many forms available - anything no more powerful than your native form. For a human, this includes cats, insects, owls, and wolves. If you can assume more powerful forms, add the difference between the maximum racial template cost and the cost of your native template to the base 100 points. For instance, a human who can take on any racial template worth up to 75 points would pay 175 points for Morph. You may improve this limit with earned character points.<br>
You can always take on the form of a being you can see or touch, provided its racial template cost does not exceed your maximum. Once you have assumed a form, you can opt to memorize it by concentrating for one minute. This allows you to shapeshift into that form at any time. You can memorize a number of forms equal to your IQ. If all your slots are full, you must overwrite a previously memorized form (your choice) to add the new form.<br>
As with Alternate Form, the racial template of whatever you turn into replaces your native racial template. You may not add traits to templates, but you may freely omit racial mental disadvantages (e.g., Bestial), and you may always choose to drop the racial IQ modifier from a template and use your own IQ. Such changes raise the cost of animal templates, which are cheap due to limited mental capabilities. If you intend to do this, you should spend more than the minimum 100 points on Morph.<br>
Morph includes the ability to make cosmetic changes. This lets you impersonate a specific member of any race you can turn into. You can always impersonate someone who is present - but to assume his form later on, you must commit a memory slot to that form. With enough points in Morph, you can use this function to improve appearance. For instance, 115 points in Morph would let you give yourself any appearance from Horrific to Handsome. Cosmetic changes still take the usual 10 seconds.<br>
Shapeshifting Races: Members of a race with the Morph ability must subtract the point cost of Morph from racial cost when determining what forms they can assume.<br>
Example: Blue Blobs have a racial Morph ability worth 125 points - the basic ability, plus 25 points of extra capacity. This lets them assume forms worth 25 points more than their native one. With their other traits, their total racial cost is 175 points. However, for the purpose of Morph, they are considered to have a racial cost of 175 - 125 = 50 points. With their 25 points of additional capacity, Blue Blobs can turn into creatures worth up to 75 points.<br>
Doppelgangers: Alien blobs, liquidmetal robots, and horrific monsters that replace their prey can assume the form of almost any living being they sample, within the limits of their mass. This is Morph with Mass Conservation (-20%) and Needs Sample (from -5% for a robot that needs a single cell to -50% for a monster that devours its victims) - often with many points of extra capacity. Some robots and aliens can shift into unliving forms. A robot restricted to unliving forms is about as limited as a living being that can only take living forms; there's no extra cost. To assume living and unliving forms, add Unlimited (+50%).<br>
Mythic Morphs: Gods and wizards in many tales can instantly take the form of any earthly creature. This powerful capability is Morph, with a lot of extra capacity to cover strong, capable forms - like tigers and sharks - while retaining IQ. No Memorization Required (+50%) and Reduced Time 4 (+80%) agree with most tales. The Unlimited enhancement (+50%) is common but not universal.<br>
<hr>
</p><h3 class="card">Special Enhancements</h3><p class="card">
Unlimited: You can become anything the GM has defined with a racial template. This lets you turn into robots, vehicles, etc. as well as living beings. Most ordinary inanimate objects - such as bricks and toasters - are worth 0 points or less. With the GM's permission, you can become a typical example of an object like this without the need for a specific racial template. +50%.<br>
Active Change: Your transformation takes the usual amount of time, but you needn't concentrate during this time - you can move and act. You have the abilities of the form you're changing from until the transition is complete. (GMs who enjoy extra detail can average the forms' statistics, or even use a weighted average to reflect how far along the change has come.) +20%.<br>
Improvised Forms: Only for Morph. You can improvise new racial templates as you change, mixing and matching the natural physical traits you desire. Possibilities range from modifying your native form with a useful body part to creating a completely new template. Improvised templates can't cost more than what you can afford with your Morph ability, but can include physical disadvantages to reduce costs. All traits added must exist in your game world, unless you also have Cosmic (+50%). You can't change your composition (e.g., add elemental meta-traits or Insubstantiality) without Unlimited (+50%). +100%.<br>
No Memorization Required: Only for Morph. Any shape you take instantly becomes part of your repertoire, unless you don't want to memorize it for some reason. +50%.<br>

</p><h3 class="card">Special Limitations</h3><p class="card">
Cosmetic: You can only change your outward appearance. Your abilities and racial template are unaffected. -50%. This limitation includes Mass Conservation, but not Retains Shape.<br>
Mass Conservation: All your forms have the same weight. If the weight of your native form falls outside the normal racial weight range for a race, you simply cannot become a member of that race. The GM should be merciless when enforcing this limitation - no 150-lb. mice or elephants! -20%.<br>
Retains Shape: You can only assume forms with the same number of limbs, body layout, posture, etc. as your native form. This would limit a human Morph to humanoids (e.g., elves and giants), a wolf Morph to horizontal quadrupeds, and a bird Morph to other birds. -20%.<br>
Cannot Memorize Forms: Only for Morph. You can't memorize the forms you copy. To assume a form, you must always be able to see or touch the original. -50%.<br>
Flawed: Only for Morph. Every form you take is cosmetically imperfect in some way, which completely precludes impersonation. You still gain the abilities of your new form. Flawed is mutually incompatible with Cosmetic. -10%.<br>
Needs Sample: Only for Morph. You must physically sample anything you wish to take the form of. If your target is living, this sample must be fresh - you can't sample a rotting corpse. -5% if you need only touch the target; -15% if you require a drop of blood, strand of hair, etc.; -50% if you must eat the whole target.<br>
Unliving Forms Only: Only for Morph. You can turn into objects but not creatures. You enjoy most of the capabilities of the Unlimited enhancement, but you can't assume the template of anything alive. -0%.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>SHRINKING</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>5 points/level</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You can shrink at will. Each level of Shrinking lets you change your Size Modifier by -1, at the rate of -1 SM per second. You return to normal size at the same rate. By default, you cannot carry any equipment, not even clothing, when you shrink. The ability to carry objects while shrunk is an enhancement.<br>
When you shrink, find your new height from the Size Modifier Table (p. 19). Every -6 to SM reduces height by a factor of 10. Reduce Move, reach, damage (with unarmed attacks, Innate Attacks, or shrunken weapons), HP, and DR in proportion to height. Every full -2 to SM also reduces weight by a factor of 10; for odd-numbered levels, treat the extra -1 as an additional factor of 3 (e.g., -3 to SM reduces weight by a factor of 30).<br>
Example: A 5'10-tall character (SM 0) has Shrinking 12. This lets him shrink until he has SM -12, reducing his height by a factor of 100 (to about 0.7). However, at that size he has only 1% his usual Move, reach, HP, and DR, and must divide any damage he inflicts by 100. His weight goes down by a factor of 1,000,000!<br>
Affects Others: You can bring your friends with you when you shrink! +50% per person you can affect at the same time.<br>
Can Carry Objects: You may carry objects. This is limited to equipment you are actually carrying or wearing when you shrink. Such items regain normal size when put down; at the GM's option, they might sweep you aside as they grow, or even return to normal size beneath you, stranding you high above the ground! No encumbrance is +10%; Light, +20%; Medium, +50%; Heavy, +100%.<br>
Full Damage: You inflict full damage when shrunk. (GMs be warned: this makes for an almost perfect assassin.) +100%.<br>
Full DR: You retain full DR when shrunk. +30%.<br>
Full HP: You retain full HP when shrunk. +30%.<br>
Full Move: You retain full Move when shrunk. +30%.</p,></div></div>

<div><h2 class='points'>1 point</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You have a cool move or slick feature that sets you apart from the masses. This provides no combat or reaction bonuses, and you can’t use it to earn money, but it might occasionally give you some minor benefit in play (GM’s discretion). Example: your clothing is always spotless, even after combat or swimming the Nile; you can run, climb, fight, etc. while wearing high heels without suffering any special penalty for bad footing.</p,></div></div>

You must explain where it came from: you won your starship in a card game, inherited your magic sword from your mentor, etc.<br>
For equipment normally bought with money, such as weapons and armor, each point in Signature Gear gives goods worth up to 50% of the average campaign starting wealth (but never cash). For anything built as a character, use the rules under Allies (p. 36) instead. It is up to the GM whether to treat android companions, faithful steeds, custom vehicles, etc. as equipment (with a cash cost) or characters (with a point cost).</p,></div></div>

These bonuses help only in the dark, or against listening devices, blind creatures, and others who must rely on hearing to find you.<br>
Dynamic: Your ability actively cancels out the sounds you make when you move, or helps them blend in with ambient noise. You enjoy your full Stealth bonus (+2 per level) when moving. +40%.</p,></div></div>

You tend to ignore everything else while obsessed (roll vs. Will to avoid this), and have -5 to all rolls to notice interruptions.<br>
The GM may rule that certain complex tasks (e.g., inventing, magic, and social activities) require you to divide your attention. This trait has no effect in such situations.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>SLIPPERY</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>2 points/level</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You are hard to hold! You might be slimy, molecularly smooth, or surrounded by a force field that negates friction. Each level of this trait (maximum five levels) gives +1 on all ST, DX, and Escape rolls to slip restraints, break free in close combat, or squeeze through narrow openings.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>SNATCHER</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>80 points</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You have the power to find almost any small item you desire in an alternate world and snatch it across the dimensions to you. The items you snatch do not come from your own world, but from some nameless parallel; therefore, you can never intentionally take something away from a specific other person. Note that this talent does not allow you to visit alternate worlds in person - only to steal from them.<br>
To make a snatch, you must first concentrate for 10 seconds and clearly visualize the item you want. The item must be able to fit in one hand, and cannot weigh more than 5 lbs. You should have a hand free (if your hands are tied, you roll at -3), and others can see you making reaching motions with that hand.<br>
Next, make an IQ roll for the snatch attempt. If you are trying for information in any form, the GM makes this roll for you (see below). Regardless of IQ, a roll of 14 or more always fails.<br>
On a success, the desired item appears in your hand - or sitting within arm's reach, if you prefer. On a failure, you obtain nothing. On a critical failure, you snatched the wrong item! This item is not immediately dangerous unless you were trying for something dangerous.<br>
Regardless of success or failure, each snatch attempt costs 2 FP.<br>
<hr>
Items Available<br>
In theory, you can get anything. In practice, some things are so hard to find that it is little use trying for them. You have a good chance of getting any item that exists, or that ever existed, in your own world - or any reasonably similar item. If the desired item is unusual, the GM may apply a penalty to the IQ roll:<br>
Item is significantly different from anything that ever appeared in your own world: -1 or more (GM's option). You could visualize a perfect diamond, bright green, the size of a hen's egg, carved into the shape of a typewriter, but you might be rolling at -20!<br>
Item is unique or almost unique in any one world (e.g., the Hope Diamond): -3 or worse (GM's option).<br>
You cannot clearly visualize what you want: -4 or worse (GM's option). Even on a success, you might not get what you were really hoping for.<br>
You cannot get an item that works by natural laws wholly different from those in your world. For instance, if your world is nonmagical (or has no magic that you know of), you cannot snatch a magic item, because you are unable to visualize it properly; you would get a pretty but powerless mundane item. Similarly, if you are from a low-TL world, you could not get a laser pistol; you wouldn't be able to visualize it well, and your best effort would be a broken or toy gun. (A generous GM might bend this rule on a critical success . . . and then let the poor Snatcher try to figure out how to use his amulet or laser pistol without killing himself.)<br>
Information is not available except in the form of ordinary textbooks, reports, etc. You can grab a history book, but you can't ask for The Book of What Happens Next in My Adventure. Note that the GM makes the roll if information is requested. If the roll fails by 5 or more, the information comes from an alternate world with different history, physics, etc., and is wrong - maybe subtly, maybe not subtly at all!<br>
<hr>
Repeated Attempts<br>
If your snatch attempt is unsuccessful, you can immediately try to snatch the same or a similar object again. These repeated attempts are made at a cumulative -1 to the IQ roll. Each repeated attempt costs 4 FP instead of the usual 2 FP. To eliminate these penalties, wait one hour between attempts.<br>
The GM should be strict about attempts to circumvent this. For instance, a .45 pistol is not very different from a .357 pistol for the purpose of this advantage. Furthermore, ignore critical successes on repeated attempts made in quick succession. If the snatch being attempted is very difficult, there is little choice but to wait an hour between attempts.<br>
<hr>
Duration<br>
The objects you snatch remain until you voluntarily return them or use your Snatcher ability again. To keep objects indefinitely, take the Permanent enhancement (below).<br>
<hr>
</p><h3 class="card">Special Enhancements</h3><p class="card">
Permanent: Objects you snatch don't vanish when you use your ability again. The GM is free to forbid this enhancement, as it allows a single Snatcher to amass boundless wealth by snatching small, valuable objects. +300%.<br>
Creation: You don't take items from anywhere - you create them on the spot. You can get anything you've seen personally, and items sufficiently close to these things that you can visualize them. There are never any penalties for item type. You still can't get impossible items, you can only have one created item at a time unless you also take Permanent, and normal weight and size limits apply. +100%.<br>
Large Items: You're not bound by the restriction that the items you snatch must fit in one hand. They can be any size, as long as they're within your weight limit. Large items too heavy to lift always appear at arm's reach. +50%.<br>
More Weight: Your weight limit is higher than 5 lbs.<br>

Each further +30% multiplies weight by 10 (e.g., a ton is +80%). If your weight limit exceeds your onehanded lift (2xBL), you must also take the Large Items enhancement.<br>
<hr>
</p><h3 class="card">Special Limitations</h3><p class="card">
Specialized: You can only grab a certain type of object, or cannot touch a certain class of thing. Examples: Only metal, -5%; Only money, -10%; Only weapons, -10%; Only information, -20%; No metal, -20%; Only blue things, -25%. The GM sets the limitation value using the guidelines under Accessibility (p. 110).<br>
Stunning: You are mentally stunned after a successful snatch. -10%.<br>
Unpredictable: On a failed IQ roll, you get something, but it isn't what you wanted. The worse the failure, the more different the item is. If you wanted a loaded pistol, failure by 1 might bring an unloaded pistol. Failure by 2 could mean a water pistol, failure by 3 a book on How to Shoot, and so on . . . with a critical failure bringing a live hand grenade. Any critical failure is dangerous, regardless of what you were looking for! -25%.<br>
Recall: You call existing objects to you across space or dimensions. These must be personal possessions. You could summon your sidearm - or even your battlesuit, with More Weight - but not someone else's belongings, let alone items you've merely heard of. This still requires 10 seconds, 2 FP, and an IQ roll, but no penalties apply. Recalled items remain indefinitely, as if you had physically retrieved them. As usual, you can send the items back at any time. Recall is incompatible with Creation, Permanent, and Unpredictable. -25%.<br>

<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>SOCIAL CHAMELEON</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>5 points</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You have the knack of knowing exactly what to say - and when to say it - around your social betters. You are exempt from reaction penalties due to differences in Rank or Status. In situations where there would be no such penalty, you get +1 on reactions from those who demand respect (priests, kings, etc.). This is a cinematic advantage!</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>SOCIAL REGARD</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>5 points per +1 reaction</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You are a member of a class, race, sex, or other group that your society holds in high regard. To be an advantage, this must be obvious to anyone who meets you. This is the opposite of Social Stigma (p. 155); membership in a given social group cannot result in both Social Regard and Social Stigma.<br>
Social Regard costs 5 points per +1 to reaction rolls, to a maximum of +4. This is not a Reputation, despite the similarities in cost and effect. You are treated well because of what you are, not because of who you are. Think of it as privilege by association.<br>
The way you are treated on a good reaction roll will depend on the type of Regard:<br>
Feared: Others will react to you much as if you had successfully used Intimidation skill (p. 202). Those who like you stand aside, while those who dislike you flee rather than risk a confrontation. You are met with silent deference, and perhaps even respect, but never friendly familiarity. Examples: a god among men or an Amazon warrior.<br>
Respected: You receive polite and obsequious deference, much as if you had high Status (p. 28), regardless of your actual Status. Social interactions other than combat usually go smoothly for you - but there will be times when the kowtowing gets in the way. Examples: a member of a priest caste or a ruling race.<br>
Venerated: Total strangers react to you in a caring way. They give up seats, let you ahead of them in lines, and receive your every word as pearls of wisdom. They also take great pains to prevent you from putting yourself in danger or even discomfort - even when you need to do so! Example: an elderly person in many societies.</p,></div></div>

<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>SPEAK WITH ANIMALS</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>25 points</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You can converse with animals. The quality of information you receive depends on the beast's IQ and the GM's decision on what the animal has to say. Insects and other tiny creatures might only be able to convey emotions such as hunger and fear, while a chimp or a cat might be able to engage in a reasonably intelligent discussion. It takes one minute to ask one question and get the answer - if the animal decides to speak at all. The GM may require a reaction roll (+2 to reactions if you offer food).<br>
The GM is free to rule that alien, unnatural, or mythical beasts don't count as animals for the purpose of this advantage.<br>
Sapience: The animals you converse with temporarily function as if they had your IQ. They are still limited to their natural perceptions, but can frame these in terms you can grasp. For instance, if an ant sensed 10 sets of footfalls and the scent of humans when the sun was low, it might say, Ten men came past here before sundown. +40%.<br>
Universal: You can speak with any nonsapient creature, however alien, supernatural, or weird. Universal is mutually exclusive with Specialized. +20%.<br>

<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>SPEAK WITH PLANTS</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>15 points</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You can communicate empathically with plants. All earthly plants are IQ 0, but a large tree might be wiser than the average ivy, at the GM's whim. A plant might know how recently it was watered or walked on, or something else that directly bears on its well-being, but would be unable to relate an overheard phone conversation. Any normal plant will always cooperate, within the limits of its ability.<br>
Sapience: The plants you converse with function as if they had your IQ, as described for the enhancement of the same name under Speak With Animals (above). +40%.<br>
Specialized: You can only communicate with certain plants. All terrestrial plants (including all trees, bushes, and herbs) and All aquatic plants (including algae, kelp, and seaweed) are -40%; a large subset of either (e.g., Trees or Herbs), -50%; a smaller subset (e.g., Evergreens or Medicinal Herbs), -60%.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>SPECIAL RAPPORT</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>5 points</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You have a unique bond with another person. This acts as a potent version of Empathy (p. 51) that works only with one person, without regard to distance. You always know when your partner is in trouble, in pain, lying, or in need of help, no matter where he is. This requires no IQ roll. Your partner receives the same benefits with respect to you.<br>
Both partners in a Special Rapport must buy this advantage. Your partner need not be a lover, or even a close friend, but the GM has the final say. In particular, the GM may wish to forbid PCs from buying Special Rapports with powerful NPCs who would otherwise qualify as Patrons (or allow it, but require an Unusual Background).<br>
One-Way: Your link lets you sense the status of your partner without him having this advantage and being able to sense your condition. +20%.<br>
Transferable: You have a link that you can actively attach to anyone. Your subject must be present. Attachment requires a minute and an IQ roll. Success means you and your subject have a Special Rapport until you reassign your link. To have multiple links, buy more than one Special Rapport with Transferable. Transferable often accompanies One- Way. +100% to affect only your own race; +150% to affect any living being or all Digital Minds; +250% to affect any sapient being, living or machine. Add -50% if the subject must be willing or helpless for the initial attachment.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>SPINES</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>1 or 3 points</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You have sharp spines, like those of a porcupine or an echidna, located on strategic parts of your body. This is defensive weaponry, intended to discourage attackers; you cannot use your Spines actively. However, you get a DX-4 roll to hit each foe in close combat with you once per turn, as a free action. Roll at +2 against foes who attacked you from behind. Those who grapple or slam you are hit immediately and automatically - and those who slam you take maximum damage!<br>
Short Spines: One or two inches long. Do 1d-2 impaling damage. Reach C. 1 point.<br>
Long Spines: One or two feet long. Do 1d impaling damage. Reach C. 3 points.</p,></div></div>

<div><h2 class='points'>10 points</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You are in tune with spirits, and receive the benefits of Empathy (p. 51) when dealing with them. You can get a feeling for the general intentions of any spirit you encounter by making a successful IQ roll. As well, your Influence skills (Diplomacy, Sex Appeal, etc.) work normally on spirits, which sets you aside from most mortals. Spirit Empathy does not prevent evil or mischievous spirits from seeking to harm you, but at the GM's option, it might make it easier to detect and counter their plots.<br>
<hr>
</p><h3 class="card">Special Limitations</h3><p class="card">
Specialized: You are naturally in tune with the customs and moods of one specific class of spirits. Possibilities include angels, demons, elementals, faerie, ghosts, and anything else the GM wishes to allow. -50%.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>STATUS</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>5 points/level</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>Status is a measure of social standing. In most game worlds, Status levels range from -2 (serf or street person) to 8 (powerful emperor or godking), with the average man being Status 0 (freeman or ordinary citizen). If you do not specifically buy Status, you have Status 0. Status costs 5 points per level. For instance, Status 5 costs 25 points, while Status -2 is -10 points. Status also costs money to maintain (see p. 516).<br>
Status is not the same as personal popularity (see Reputation, p. 26) or the popularity of your racial or ethnic group (see Social Regard, p. 86, and Social Stigma, p. 155). Status can sometimes influence others’ reactions, but its main effect is to spell out where you stand in the social pecking order. In short, Status represents power.<br>
<hr>
High Status<br>
Status greater than 0 means you are a member of the ruling class in your culture. Your family may be hereditary nobles (e.g., Plantagenet, Windsor), successful businessmen or politicians (Rockefeller, Kennedy), or some other type of big shots. You may even have achieved Status by your own efforts. As a result, others in your culture only defer to you, giving you a bonus on all reaction rolls.<br>
High Status carries various privileges, different in every game world; your GM will give you this information. Note that any high-Status person is a likely target for kidnappers and social climbers, and that some criminal types hate “the ruling class.”<br>
<hr>
Low Status<br>
Status less than 0 means you are a serf or a slave, or simply very poor. This is not the same thing as Social Stigma (p. 155). In medieval Japan, for instance, a woman could have high Status, but still get a -1 on reactions due to the Social Stigma of being female. A modern-day criminal could theoretically have any level of Status in conjunction with the Social Stigma of a criminal record.<br>
The interaction of Status, Social Stigma, and Reputation can give interesting results. For instance, a person who is obviously from a lower social class, or even a disdained minority group, might earn such a reputation as a hero that others react well to him.<br>
<hr>
Status as a Reaction Modifier<br>
When the GM makes a reaction roll (see p. 494), the relative Status of the characters involved can affect the reaction. The GM can roleplay NPCs as he likes, of course, but here are some general guidelines:<br>
Higher Status usually gives a reaction bonus. When dealing with a social inferior, apply the difference between your Status levels as a reaction bonus – except, of course, when dealing with someone who resents Status. For instance, if you have Status 3, those of Status 1 react to you at +2, and those of Status 0 react at +3.<br>
Lower Status may give a penalty. If you are dealing with a higher-Status NPC who is basically friendly, your Status doesn’t matter (as long as it’s positive). After all, the king has a far higher Status than his knights, but he reacts well to them . . . most of the time. But if the NPC is neutral or already angry, lower Status makes it worse (“How dare you, a mere knight, tell me my battle plan is foolish?”). Again, apply the difference in Status levels as a reaction modifier, but in this case it gives a penalty.<br>
Negative Status usually gives a penalty. If your Status is so low as to be negative, those of higher Status always react badly to you. Apply the difference between your Status and the NPC’s as a reaction penalty, but no worse than -4.<br>
<hr>
Recognizing Status<br>
Status only affects reaction rolls if it is obvious to those around you. In some settings, your bearing, dress, and speech communicate your Status. Indeed, if you have very high Status, your face may be easily recognized – or perhaps the gaggle of servants that surrounds you gets the message across.<br>
In other societies, you will have to produce physical proof (ID cards, signet rings, etc.), pass a test, or submit to ultra-tech or magical scans before you will be recognized. Status costs no fewer points in such societies; you may get fewer reaction bonuses, but you can also live a normal life, and it is far more difficult for someone to impersonate you.<br>

<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>STRETCHING</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>6 points/level</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You can stretch your body in any direction. Each level of Stretching lets you increase your effective SM by +1 with any body part without increasing your overall SM. You can elongate your arms to increase reach (but not swinging damage, as Stretching gives no extra mass or muscle), your legs to negotiate obstacles, your neck to see over barriers, etc. For more information, see Size Modifier and Reach (p. 402). Your body parts grow or shrink at the rate of ±1 SM per second.<br>
By itself, Stretching is ideal for machines with telescoping manipulators. A super with a rubber body should add some combination of Elastic Skin (p. 51), Double-Jointed (p. 56), Morph (p. 84), and Super Jump (p. 89).<br>
Force Extension: You can project visible, semisolid force fields that act as extensions of your limbs. Treat this like unmodified Stretching, except that the extensions of your limbs past their physical reach aren't subject to injury. You must still move your limbs as if reaching, kicking, stepping, etc., and you still need a free hand to pick something up or wield a weapon. You're limited to your natural ST and DX, and can't take actions that are impossible with a real limb (e.g., reaching through a wall). This isn't Telekinesis (p. 82), but suits any power that includes it. +50%.<br>
Limited: You can only stretch certain body parts. Arms Only and Legs Only are -20%, Single Limb is -40%, and Neck Only is -50%. The GM may allow other limitations, but Arms and Legs Only isn't a meaningful limitation.</p,></div></div>

<div><p class='card'>You have a body part that you can use to strike an aimed blow, but not to manipulate objects (see Extra Arms, p. 53) or walk on (see Extra Legs, p. 54). This might be a set of horns or protruding tusks, a heavy tail, a stinger, or any number of other natural weapons.<br>
Your Striker can attack at reach C (close combat only), inflicting thrust damage at +1 per die; e.g., 2d-1 becomes 2d+1. Damage is crushing or piercing for 5 points, large piercing for 6 points, cutting for 7 points, or impaling for 8 points. See Innate Attack (p. 61) for details.<br>
Roll against DX or Brawling to hit with your Striker. You can also use it to parry as if you had a weapon. Use the higher of (DX/2) + 3 or your Brawling parry.<br>
<hr>
</p><h3 class="card">Special Enhancements</h3><p class="card">
Long: Your Striker is long relative to your body. This increases your effective SM for the purpose of calculating reach (see Size Modifier and Reach, p. 402). +100% per +1 to SM if you can attack at any reach from C to maximum, or +75% per +1 to SM if you can only attack at maximum reach (and never in close combat).<br>
<hr>
</p><h3 class="card">Special Limitations</h3><p class="card">
Cannot Parry: You cannot parry with your Striker. -40%.<br>
Clumsy: Your Striker is unusually inaccurate. This is common for tails and similar Strikers aimed from outside your usual arc of vision. -20% per -1 to hit.<br>
Limited Arc: Your Striker can only attack straight ahead, straight behind, etc. Specify a direction when you buy the Striker. If your target isn't in the right place, and you cannot maneuver to put him there, you cannot attack him at all. -40%.<br>
Weak: Your Striker is unusually blunt or light, or simply incapable of using your full ST. It inflicts only basic thrust damage, without the +1 per die. -50%.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>STRIKING ST</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>5 points per +1 ST</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You can strike more powerful blows than your ST score would indicate. Add Striking ST to base ST solely for the purpose of calculating thrust and swing damage (see Damage Table, p. 16). Striking ST has no effect on HP or Basic Lift. If you bought your ST with the No Fine Manipulators or Size limitation, apply the same limitation(s) to Striking ST.<br>
One Attack Only: Your Striking ST only affects one specific natural attack: your bite, a particular Striker, etc. This limitation is intended for a relatively weak creature with an unusually high-ST attack; e.g., a giant rat that can gnaw through armor and bone. -60%.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>SUBSONIC HEARING</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>0 or 5 points</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You can hear very low-frequency sounds (under 40 Hz), such as the rumble of distant storms, the vibrations from incipient earthquakes, and the approach of stampeding herd beasts, armored vehicles, or dragons. This gives +1 to Tracking skill if your quarry is moving on the ground. Cost depends on your capabilities:<br>
You can hear very low-frequency sounds only: 0 points.<br>
You can hear very low-frequency sounds and other sounds: 5 points.<br>
Note that Subsonic Hearing is included in the cost of Subsonic Speech (below); you cannot take both traits.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>SUBSONIC SPEECH</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>0 or 10 points</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You can converse using extremely low-frequency sounds. This trait includes Subsonic Hearing, above. Subsonic speech is slow (half-speed), and even if the frequency is shifted into the normal range, subsonic speakers are at -2 to Fast-Talk and any other skill where versatile speaking is important. However, subsonic speech carries twice as far as normal speech. Cost depends on your capabilities:<br>
You can only communicate via Subsonic Speech: 0 points.<br>
You can switch between regular speech and Subsonic Speech at will: 10 points.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>SUPER CLIMBING</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>3 points/level</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You can climb very quickly. Each level of Super Climbing gives you +1 Move when climbing or using the Clinging advantage (p. 43).<br>
Requires Low Gravity: Your ability doesn't function in gravity fields over a certain, maximum strength. -5% per 0.1G under 1G (-5% for 0.9G, -10% for 0.8G, and so on - down to -50% for 0G).</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>SUPER JUMP</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>10 points/level</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You can make superhuman leaps! Each level of Super Jump doubles the distance and height you can achieve when jumping (see Jumping, p. 352). Your Move while jumping is the greater of your normal ground Move and 1/5 your maximum long jump distance (thus, your maximum jump never takes more than five seconds). For instance, if your long jump were 100 yards, your jumping Move would be the greater of 20 and your normal ground Move.<br>
You can jump at a foe in order to slam him. Figure the slam at your maximum jumping Move! You don't need to make a separate roll to jump accurately.<br>
Finally, if you fall a distance less than or equal to your maximum high jump, you take no damage. You can increase this distance by five yards with a successful Acrobatics roll.<br>
Jets: Jets of energy or matter powerful enough to provide Super Jump are sufficiently noisy and dangerous to rate Nuisance Effect (-5%). A rocket with a fixed burn has Full Power Only (-10%) - and one of Horizontal Only (-25%), Projectile (-20%), or Vertical Only (-25%), if it can't be steered.<br>
Levitation: Telekinetics and gravitycontrolling supers not gifted enough to fly can still make amazing leaps. Most have either Lighter Than Air (-10%) or Maneuverable (+50%), and those that use antigravity should take Planetary (-5%), too.<br>
Bouncing: You can rebound like a rubber ball. Your Super Jump works normally, but you also get a roll against the best of DX, Acrobatics, or Jumping when you experience a fall or collision - deliberate or otherwise. Roll at -5 per multiple of your jumping Move, or fraction thereof, by which your velocity exceeds your jumping Move. Success means you take no damage and rebound with 90% of your impact velocity. If this doesn't exceed your jumping Move, you can choose to stop instead; otherwise, you must bounce. Failure means you take normal damage and stop (Splat!). +50%.<br>
Maneuverable: You can make midair course corrections. Calculate distance and hang time as usual, but while airborne, treat your jumping Move as air Move, exactly as if you had Flight. For instance, if you can jump 100 yards at 20 yards per second, you can fly at Move 20 for five seconds before landing. Maneuverable is mutually exclusive with all of the special limitations below except Planetary. +50%.<br>
Full Power Only: You must always jump your maximum distance when you use Super Jump. The only way to make shorter hops is to jump without using this advantage. -10%.<br>
Horizontal Only: You can only increase your horizontal (broad jump) distance. Your ability doesn't benefit high jumps, and has no special effect on falling damage. -25%.<br>
Lighter Than Air: You jump by becoming lighter than air. For each second you're airborne, your landing zone drifts a yard in the direction the wind is blowing per 5 mph of wind speed. For instance, if you're in the air for three seconds in a 20 mph wind from the west, you'll land 12 yards east of your intended target. -10%.<br>
Planetary: You jump by pushing off against a planet's gravitational or magnetic field. Your ability is useless in the absence of a planet. -5%.<br>
Projectile: You can only launch yourself directly at your objective. You're an unguided missile, spinning out of control! You can do nothing while airborne, and have no active defenses. Make a DX or Jumping roll on landing. Failure means you collide with your target or the ground - unless you intended to do so, in which case you miss and crash into something nearby. In either case, you suffer full normal collision damage. -20%.<br>
Vertical Only: You can only increase your vertical (high jump) distance and reduce falling damage. Your ability doesn't benefit broad jumps. This is mutually exclusive with Horizontal Only. -25%.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>SUPER LUCK</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>100 points</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You are not just lucky - you have limited control over probability. Once per hour of play, you may dictate the result of any one die roll you make (or the GM makes for you) instead of rolling the dice. Wholly impossible attempts cannot succeed (your effective skill level must be at least 3), but you can choose any result that would be possible - however improbable - on a single normal die roll.<br>
You can have Super Luck and any degree of normal Luck, but no one can take Super Luck more than once!<br>
Alter Reality: Your Super Luck works retroactively. You can wait until after you roll and then specify a different result, altering the past. You must declare this immediately. Once you or anyone else has made another roll, the flow of time becomes too complex for you to unravel. Alter Reality always produces visible effects; e.g., time rewinds and replays differently, or a glowing hand reaches down from the heavens and changes things. +75%.<br>
Wishing: You can specify the result of any die roll made in your presence. You must personally witness the action you wish to influence. Normal usage limits apply. +100% if you can affect your rolls and those of others; +0% if you can aid others but not yourself.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>SUPERNATURAL DURABILITY</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>150 points</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>Like a vampire or psycho killer from a horror movie, you can shake off most wounds. Injury comes off HP as usual, and you suffer knockback, but you are completely immune to shock, physical stun, and knockout. You don't need High Pain Threshold - this ability includes that one, and is far more potent!<br>
As long as you have 0 or more HP, you are also immune to crippling injuries, and have your full Move. Below 0 HP, you are at half Move, and can be crippled, but you won't die unless you are wounded by an attack to which you are specifically vulnerable (see below). The sole exception to this is a single attack that inflicts an injury of 10xHP or more. That much damage at once will blow you apart, killing you.<br>
To die, you must first be wounded to -HP or worse. After that, one specific item can kill you. You must specify this when you buy Supernatural Durability. Valid categories appear under Limited Defenses (p. 46); the item that can kill you must be of Occasional rarity or higher. If wounds from this item ever reduce your HP to the point where a normal human would have to make HT rolls to survive, you must make those HT rolls or die. If this item wounds you to -5xHP, you die automatically. If you are already below -5xHP from other damage, any wound from this item will kill you. Any item to which you have a Vulnerability (p. 161) can also kill you in this way.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>TALENT</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>Variable</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You have a natural aptitude for a set of closely related skills. Talents come in levels, and give the following benefits:<br>
* A bonus of +1 per level with all affected skills, even for default use. This effectively raises your attribute scores for the purpose of those skills only; thus, this is an inexpensive way to be adept at small class of skills. (Generalists will find it more costeffective to raise attributes.)<br>
* A bonus of +1 per level on all reaction rolls made by anyone in a position to notice your Talent, if he would be impressed by your aptitude (GM's judgment). To receive this bonus, you must demonstrate your Talent - most often by using the affected skills.<br>
* A reduction in the time required to learn the affected skills in play, regardless of how you learn them. Reduce the time required by 10% per level of Talent; e.g., Animal Friend 2 would let you learn animal-related skills in 80% the usual time. This has no effect on the point cost of your skills.<br>
You may never have more than four levels of a particular Talent. However, overlapping Talents can give skill bonuses (only) in excess of +4.<br>
<hr>
Cost of Talents<br>
The cost of a Talent depends on the size of the group of skills affected:<br>
Small (6 or fewer related skills): 5 points/level.<br>
Medium (7 to 12 related skills): 10 points/level.<br>
Large (13 or more related skills): 15 points/level.<br>
Skills with multiple specialties are considered to be one skill for this purpose.<br>
Once you buy a Talent, the list of affected skills is fixed. (Exception: The GM may rule that a Talent affects new skills appearing in later GURPS supplements, or skills he invents in the course of the campaign, if the Talent would logically be of value to those skills.)<br>
<hr>
Examples of Talents<br>
The following Talents are considered standard, and exist in most campaigns:<br>
Animal Friend: Animal Handling, Falconry, Packing, Riding, Teamster, and Veterinary. Reaction bonus: all animals. 5 points/level.<br>
Artificer: Armoury, Carpentry, Electrician, Electronics Repair, Engineer, Machinist, Masonry, Mechanic, and Smith. Reaction bonus: anyone you do work for. 10 points/level.<br>
Business Acumen: Accounting, Administration, Economics, Finance, Gambling, Market Analysis, Merchant, and Propaganda. Reaction bonus: anyone you do business with. 10 points/level.<br>
Gifted Artist: Artist, Jeweler, Leatherworking, Photography, and Sewing. Reaction bonus: anyone buying or critiquing your work. 5 points/level.<br>
Green Thumb: Biology, Farming, Gardening, Herb Lore, and Naturalist. Reaction bonus: gardeners and sentient plants. 5 points/level.<br>
Healer: Diagnosis, Esoteric Medicine, First Aid, Pharmacy, Physician, Physiology, Psychology, Surgery, and Veterinary. Reaction bonus: patients, both past and present. 10 points/level.<br>
Mathematical Ability: Accounting, Astronomy, Cryptography, Engineer, Finance, Market Analysis, Mathematics, and Physics. Reaction bonus: engineers and scientists. 10 points/level.<br>
Musical Ability: Group Performance (Conducting), Musical Composition, Musical Influence, Musical Instrument, and Singing. Reaction bonus: anyone listening to or critiquing your work. 5 points/level.<br>
Outdoorsman: Camouflage, Fishing, Mimicry, Naturalist, Navigation, Survival, and Tracking. Reaction bonus: explorers, nature lovers, and the like. 10 points/level.<br>
Smooth Operator: Acting, Carousing, Detect Lies, Diplomacy, Fast-Talk, Intimidation, Leadership, Panhandling, Politics, Public Speaking, Savoir-Faire, Sex Appeal, and Streetwise. Reaction bonus: con artists, politicians, salesmen, etc. - but only if you are not trying to manipulate them. 15 points/level.<br>
<hr>
Custom Talents<br>
At the GM's option, you may create your own Talent with a custom skill list. However, the GM's word is law when determining which skills are related and how may points the Talent is worth. Talents should always be believable inborn aptitudes. For instance, Sports Talent might make sense - some athletes really do seem to have a gift - but the GM ought to forbid Ninja Talent or Weapon Talent (but see Weapon Master, p. 99).</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>TEETH</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>0, 1, or 2 points</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>Anyone with a mouth has blunt teeth that can bite for thrust-1 crushing damage. This costs 0 points, and is typical of most herbivores. You have a more damaging bite:<br>
Sharp Teeth: Like those of most carnivores. Inflict thrust-1 cutting damage. 1 point.<br>
Sharp Beak: Like that of a bird of prey. Inflicts thrust-1 large piercing damage. 1 point.<br>
Fangs: Like those of a Smilodon.<br>
Inflict thrust-1 impaling damage. 2 points.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>TELECOMMUNICATION</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>Variable</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You can communicate over long distances without speaking aloud. You can send words at the speed of ordinary speech or pictures at the speed at which you could draw them. To establish contact requires one second of concentration and an IQ roll. After that, no concentration is required. You can maintain multiple contacts, but the IQ roll is at a cumulative -1 per contact after the first.<br>
Telecommunication works amid even the loudest noises, although interference and jamming can disrupt your signal. Those with suitable equipment may attempt to locate, intercept, or jam your transmission. This requires an Electronics Operation (Communications) roll for an electromagnetic signal, an Electronics Operation (Psychotronics) roll for a psionic signal, and so forth.<br>
Each variety of Telecommunication is a separate advantage with its own benefits and drawbacks. Some forms have limited range, which you can adjust using Increased Range (p. 106) or Reduced Range (p. 115).<br>
Infrared Communication: You communicate using a modulated infrared beam. Base range is 500 yards in a direct line of sight. The short range and line-of-sight requirement make jamming and eavesdropping almost impossible under normal circumstances. You can only communicate with those who have this advantage or an infrared communicator. 10 points.<br>
Laser Communication: You communicate using a modulated laser beam. Base range is 50 miles in a direct line of sight. The narrow beam and line-of-sight requirement make it extremely hard to eavesdrop on you. You can only communicate with people who have this advantage or a laser communicator. 15 points.<br>
Radio: You communicate using radio waves. Base range is 10 miles. Your signal is omnidirectional, but because you can shift frequencies, eavesdroppers must still roll vs. Electronics Operation (Communications) to listen in. A side benefit of this ability is that you can receive AM, FM, CB, and other ordinary radio signals on an IQ roll (takes one second). Note that radio-frequency noise from lightning and unshielded electronics can interfere with Radio. Radio does not work at all underwater. 10 points.<br>
Telesend: You can transmit thoughts directly to others via magic, psi, or other exotic means (be specific!). Your subject receives your thoughts even if he lacks this ability. Range is theoretically unlimited, but the IQ roll to use this ability takes the range penalties given under Long- Distance Modifiers (p. 241). If you cannot see or otherwise sense your subject, you have an additional penalty: -1 for family, lovers, or close friends; -3 for casual friends and acquaintances; or -5 for someone met only briefly. 30 points.<br>
Directional Sound: You communicate using a laser-thin sound beam. Base range is 100 yards in a direct line of sight. Jamming and eavesdropping require specialized equipment - and even then, the short range and line-ofsight requirement give -5 to attempts. Obscurants (e.g., fog and smoke) and electrical noise have no effect. You can only communicate with those who have this advantage or a directional- sound communicator. 5 points.<br>
Gravity-Ripple Comm: You communicate using gravity waves. Base range is 1,000 miles. Your signal is omnidirectional, and as with Radio, eavesdroppers must roll against Electronics Operation (Communications) to listen in. Jamming is impossible - although intense gravity sources (neutron stars, pulsars, black holes, etc.) can disrupt your signal. Gravity waves reach underwater and penetrate solid objects at no penalty. You can only communicate with people who have this advantage or a gravity- ripple communicator. 20 points.<br>
Neutrino Comm: You communicate using a modulated beam of neutrinos (or similar particles). Base range is 1,000 miles in a straight line. The beam is impossible to jam or intercept, and functions in any environment - it can reach underwater or penetrate solid objects at no penalty, and isn't blocked by the horizon. You can only communicate with people who have this advantage or a neutrino communicator. 25 points.<br>
Sonar Comm: You communicate using modulated sonar. Base range is three miles underwater. The signal is omnidirectional, and anyone with this advantage or equivalent equipment can hear you. The only way to jam this ability continuously is with powerful, specialized equipment - although explosions can cause transient interference. In air, Sonar Comm has a range of 50 yards multiplied by air pressure in atm. It doesn't work at all in vacuum. At the GM's option, Sonar Comm is equivalent to Ultrasonic Speech. 10 points.<br>
<hr>
</p><h3 class="card">Special Enhancements</h3><p class="card">
Broadcast: This enhancement is only available for Telesend. It lets you send your thoughts to everyone in a radius around you. This requires an IQ roll at the long-distance modifier for the desired radius, plus an additional -4. +50%.<br>
Short Wave: This is only available for Radio. You can bounce your signal off a planet's ionosphere (if the planet has one). This lets you transmit to (or receive from) any point on the planet. Note that solar flares, weather, etc. can disrupt short-wave communications. +50%.<br>
Universal: Your messages are automatically translated into your subject's language. The GM may limit this enhancement to individuals from advanced tech levels, or restrict it to Telesend. +50%.<br>
Video: You are not limited to simple pictures! You can transmit real-time video of anything you can see. +40%.<br>
Burst: Not available for Directional Sound or Sonar Comm. You transmit a high-speed blip that conveys information much faster than you could speak or draw. +30% for 10x normal speed, +60% for 100x, +90% for 1,000x, and so on. Each factor of 10 gives -1 to attempts to intercept the transmission.<br>
FTL: Your signal travels faster than the speed of light, letting you communicate with little or no light lag. The GM decides what kinds of Telecommunication can have this modifier and what it represents in each case: a beam of FTL energy for Radio or Gravity-Ripple Comm, a stream of FTL particles for Neutrino Comm, etc. A hyperspace tunnel that carries ordinary signals might suit any kind of Telecommunication. Recommended signal speed is 0.1 parsec/ day, to a maximum range in parsecs equal to 1/5,000 ordinary range in miles, but the GM can adjust this to suit the setting. Only individuals with the same ability or equivalent technology can receive the FTL signal. +120%.<br>
Secure: Your signal employs security measures that make it difficult to interpret if intercepted. Eavesdroppers must win a Quick Contest of IQ (if using Telecommunication) or Electronics Operation (if using technology) against your IQ to understand the content of the transmission. If they lose, they get garbage. +20%.<br>
Sensie: You can transmit your sensory impressions in real time. This is possible for any form of Telecommunication save Directional Sound or Sonar Comm - but with anything other than Telesend, the recipient needs a specially equipped receiver to get the full experience. +80%.<br>
<hr>
</p><h3 class="card">Special Limitations</h3><p class="card">
Racial: Your ability only works on those of your own race or a very similar race, per Mind Reading (p. 69). -20%.<br>
Receive Only: You can receive but not send. This limitation is not available for Telesend. -50%.<br>
Send Only: You can send but not receive. This limitation is not available for Telesend. -50%.<br>
Telepathic: Your ability is part of the Telepathy psi power (see p. 257). -10%.<br>
Vague: You cannot send speech or pictures. You can only send a simple code (e.g., Morse code) - or general concepts and emotions, in the case of Telesend. -50%.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>TELEKINESIS</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>5 points/level</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You can move objects without touching them. In effect, you manifest an invisible force that acts under your conscious direction at a distant point. Specify how you do this; possibilities include magnetism, psionic psychokinesis, an ultra-tech tractor beam, or a supernatural poltergeist effect.<br>
You can manipulate distant objects just as if you were grasping them in a pair of hands with ST equal to your Telekinesis (TK) level. You can move any object you have strength enough to lift, at a Move equal to your TK level, modified as usual for encumbrance level (see Encumbrance and Move, p. 17). Regardless of level, maximum range is 10 yards. To modify range, take Increased Range (p. 106) or Reduced Range (p. 115).<br>
Telekinesis requires constant concentration to use. In combat, this means you must take a Concentrate maneuver on your turn. Your TK may then perform one standard maneuver as if were a disembodied pair of hands at some point within your range: a Ready maneuver to pick up an object; a Move maneuver to lift and carry it; an Attack maneuver to throw it, or to grab or strike directly; and so on.<br>
Example: On your turn in combat, you take a Concentrate maneuver and state that your TK is taking an Attack maneuver to grab a gun from a foe. The following turn, you can Concentrate again and specify that your TK is taking an Aim or Wait maneuver to cover your enemy with the gun, an Attack maneuver to shoot him, or a Move maneuver to bring the gun to your hand.<br>
No rolls are necessary for ordinary lifting and movement. For more complex actions, the GM might require you to make a DX or skill roll. In situations where you would roll against ST, roll against your TK level instead.<br>
All of the above assumes that you are using TK to perform a task at a distance. TK can also discreetly assist you with such skills as Gambling (especially to cheat!), Lockpicking, and Surgery. In general, anything that would benefit from High Manual Dexterity (p. 59) gets a +4 bonus if you can successfully make an IQ roll to use your TK properly. On a failure, the GM may assess any penalty he feels is appropriate.<br>
Grappling and Striking: You can use TK to attack a foe directly. Roll against DX or an unarmed combat skill to hit. Your foe defends as if attacked by an invisible opponent (see Visibility, p. 394). If you grapple, your foe cannot grab hold of the TK force, but he can try to break free as usual - and if he also has TK, he can take a Concentrate maneuver and use his TK level instead of his ST. The turn after you grapple a foe using TK, your TK can use a Move maneuver to pick him up off the ground, provided you have enough TK to lift his weight. Someone in this position can't do anything that relies on ground contact (run, retreat, etc.), but can perform any other action that is possible while grappled.<br>
Levitation: If you have enough TK to lift your own body weight, you can levitate. Take the Concentrate maneuver and have your TK take Move maneuvers to propel your body. For true psychokinetic flight, take Flight (p. 56) with the Psychokinetic limitation (below).<br>
Throwing: By applying a TK impulse for a fraction of a second, you can throw objects faster (and farther) than you can move them. Take a Concentrate maneuver and have your TK take an Attack maneuver. This works just as if you were throwing the object with ST equal to your TK level. Roll against Throwing or Thrown Weapon skill to hit, depending on the object being hurled. For 1/2D and Max purposes, measure range from the object (not yourself!) to the target; for the purpose of range penalties, use the sum of the distance from you to the object and from the object to the target. Once you throw something, you have released your telekinetic grip - your TK must take a Ready maneuver to pick it up again.<br>
Animated Objects: A spirit that uses Possession to occupy an object (like a statue) can use TK with Animation (-30%) to make it move around. If the spirit can only use its TK in conjunction with Possession, add an Accessibility limitation (-10%). A sorcerer who makes tables gallop and mannequins dance has Animation, too - with Independent (+70%), if the items keep doing what they're doing without his attention. Together, Animation and Independent can animate one object per second. Total HP can't exceed TK level, but homogenous objects count as having half their HP.<br>
Attraction/Repulsion Field: Some force fields push everything nearby away from the user, or draw objects to him. Simulate this using Area Effect (+50%/level), Emanation (-20%), and one of Attraction (-60%), Repulsion (-60%), or Attraction/Repulsion (-30%). If the field is magnetic, add Magnetic (-50%), too. Being unable to turn this off is genuinely limiting - Always On is worth -20%.<br>
Poltergeist Effect: Certain people are the nexus of random acts of telekinetic violence when under stress. Parapsychologists refer to this phenomenon as recurrent spontaneous psychokinesis (RSPK) or the poltergeist effect. Represent this with Area Effect (+50%/level), Emanation (-20%), Unconscious Only (-20%), and Uncontrollable (-30%). In general, combinations of Area Effect and Uncontrollable always cause chaos over a wide area.<br>
Psychokinesis: Classic psionic psychokinesis is TK with the Psychokinesis power modifier (-10%).<br>
Super-Magnetism: Some supers direct magnetic forces with laserlike precision. This isn't realistic - all it has in common with real-world magnetism is that it can only affect ferrous metals, which calls for Magnetic (-50%). Increased Range (+10%/level) is common but not required.<br>
Tractor Beam: Superscience devices that project force beams capable of pushing or pulling distant objects are found on starships, robots, and mecha. These tractor beams typically have high levels of Increased Range (+10%/level) and either Attraction (-60%) or Attraction/Repulsion (-30%), and are often Visible (-20%).<br>
Super-Effort: The GM may allow the Super-Effort enhancement from Lifting ST (p. 58) on TK, too. This affects extra-effort lifts - not speed, damage, skill, or anything else. The only differences from the Lifting ST rules are that TK with Super-Effort works at a range and that its bonus adds to levels of TK that lack this modifier, not to personal ST (e.g., TK 20 gives ST 5,000, or adds 5,000 to unmodified TK, if any).<br>
<hr>
</p><h3 class="card">Special Limitations</h3><p class="card">
Magnetic: Your TK is super magnetism, and only affects ferrous metals: iron (including steel), nickel, and cobalt. -50%.<br>
Psychokinetic: Your ability is part of the Psychokinesis psi power (see p. 256). This makes it mental (2) rather than physical (3). -10%.<br>
Visible: Your TK is not an invisible force, but a disembodied hand, glowing tractor beam, or similar. This makes it much easier for others to defend against your TK attacks (do not use the Visibility rules). -20%.<br>
Animation: Your TK works by enabling inanimate objects to flex. The minimum level required to animate something equals its HP if unliving, half its HP if homogenous (see Object Hit Points Table, p. B558). An animated object can grab, lift, strike, and throw with ST equal to the TK level needed to animate it. It has your DX. It can walk and jump if it isn't fixed in place; Move equals your TK level minus the level needed to animate it. You can use skills through animated items - but note that objects other than statues and mannequins usually have No Fine Manipulators. Objects return to their rest state once you give up control. Adding Independent (p. 108) lets you animate multiple objects, but you must split your TK level among them. Your TK can't reach inside things at all. -30% if the object can't fly; -20% if it can, provided it has wings, rotors, etc. (like a toy dragon or model helicopter).<br>
Attraction/Repulsion: Your TK can only move things directly toward or away from you. Take a Ready maneuver to move an unresisting object, or an Attack maneuver to affect an active opponent. Your TK can't strike blows, manipulate objects, or hold an enemy in place or prevent him from attacking. Attraction simply causes objects to move until they're in contact with you, whereupon they're held there with your telekinetic ST until you turn off your ability. Repulsion shoves objects away from you until they reach the maximum range of your ability. In either case, objects can only move or be moved in the opposite direction if the mover wins a Quick Contest of his ST or TK level against your TK level. This limitation is incompatible with Animation. -60% for Attraction or Repulsion; -30% for Attraction/Repulsion (it takes a Ready maneuver to switch between the two).<br>
Lift Only: Levels of TK with this limitation don't add to telekinetic Move. -20%.<br>
Move Only: Levels of TK with this limitation don't add to telekinetic ST. -40%.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>TELESCOPIC VISION</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>5 points/level</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You can zoom in with your eyes as if using binoculars. Each level lets you ignore -1 in range penalties to Vision rolls at all times, or -2 in range penalties if you take an Aim maneuver to zoom in on a particular target. This ability can also function as a telescopic sight, giving up to +1 Accuracy per level with ranged attacks provided you take an Aim maneuver for seconds equal to the bonus (see Scopes under Firearm Accessories, p. 411).<br>
The benefits of this trait are not cumulative with those of technological aids such as binoculars or scopes. If you have both, you must opt to use one or the other.<br>
<hr>
</p><h3 class="card">Special Limitations</h3><p class="card">
No Targeting: Your field of vision is broad and not zeroed to your ranged attacks. You get no Accuracy bonus in combat. -60%.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>TEMPERATURE CONTROL</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>5 points/level</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You can alter the ambient temperature. Heating or cooling is limited to 20° per level, and occurs at a rate of 2° per level per second of concentration. You can affect a two-yard radius at a distance of up to 10 yards. Use Increased Range (p. 106) or Reduced Range (p. 115) to modify range; add levels of Area Effect (p. 102) to increase radius.<br>
This ability never does damage directly. For that, buy Innate Attack - usually either burning (for flame) or fatigue (for attacks that damage by altering body temperature).<br>
Active: Psis, supers, and ultra-tech machines cause temperature changes using force of will or weird beams. Freeze rays and cryokinesis call for Cold (-50%), while heat rays and pyrokinesis require Heat (-50%). For dramatic effects like freezing or boiling water instantly, add Reduced Time (+20%/level); each level doubles the rate of cooling or heating.<br>
Passive: Spirits, monsters, and elemental creatures of heat and cold sometimes alter the temperature in their immediate vicinity (a two-yard radius) at all times. To simulate this, add Always On (-10%), Emanation (-20%), and either Cold (-50%) or Heat (-50%). The ambient temperature changes by 2° per level per second the entity remains in the area, to the usual maximum of 20° per level.<br>
<hr>
</p><h3 class="card">Special Limitations</h3><p class="card">
Cold: You can only decrease the temperature. -50%.<br>
Heat: You can only increase the temperature. -50%.<br>
Psychokinetic: Your ability is part of the Psychokinesis psi power (see p. 256), often called cryokinesis (for cold) or pyrokinesis (for heat). -10%.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>TEMPERATURE TOLERANCE</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>1 point/level</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>Every character has a temperature comfort zone within which he suffers no ill effects (such as FP or HP loss) due to heat or cold. For ordinary humans, this zone is 55° wide and falls between 35° and 90°. For nonhumans, the zone can be centered anywhere, but this is a 0-point feature for a zone no larger than 55°. A larger zone is an advantage. Each level of Temperature Tolerance adds HT degrees to your comfort zone, distributed in any way you wish between the cold and hot ends of the zone.<br>
Temperature Tolerance confers no special resistance to attacks by fire or ice unless the only damage is a result of a rise or fall in the ambient temperature. In particular, it cannot help you if your body temperature is being manipulated.<br>
In a realistic campaign, the GM should limit normal humans to Temperature Tolerance 1 or 2. However, high levels of this trait are likely for nonhumans with fur or a heavy layer of fat.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>TEMPORAL INERTIA</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>15 points</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You are strongly rooted in probability. If history changes, you can remember both versions. If you are involved in a genuine time paradox, you are not erased, even if the rest of your world is! You have a place in the new timeline, whatever it is, and remember all your experiences - even the ones that never happened. (In an extreme case, you have two complete sets of memories, and must make an IQ roll any time you have to distinguish between them under stress . . . you might need Acting skill to stay out of the lunatic asylum.)<br>
There is a drawback: there is a you in any parallel or split timeline you encounter, and he is as similar to you as the timeline allows.<br>
This trait is only worthwhile in a campaign in which paradoxes or changes in history - erasing past events or whole timelines - are possible. See Unique (p. 160) for the opposite of this advantage.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>TENURE</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>5 points</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You have a job from which you cannot normally be fired. You can only lose your job (and this trait) as the result of extraordinary misbehavior: assault, gross immorality, etc. Otherwise, your employment and salary are guaranteed for life. This is most common among modern-day university professors, but also applies to judges, priests, senators, etc. in many societies.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>TERRAIN ADAPTATION</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>0 or 5 points</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You do not suffer DX or Move penalties for one specific type of unstable terrain: ice, sand, snow, etc. Cost depends on your capabilities:<br>
You can function normally on one specific type of unstable terrain, but suffer the DX and Move penalties that most characters experience on that terrain type when you traverse solid ground: 0 points.<br>
You can function at full DX and Move both on solid ground and on one particular type of unstable terrain: 5 points.<br>
You must buy this ability separately for each terrain type.<br>
Active: You adapt quickly to any terrain. Instead of specifying a particular terrain type, buy the 5-point version of Terrain Adaptation and add this enhancement. This ability might be the result of smart wheels, shapeshifting, or superhuman balance. +300%.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>TERROR</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>30 points + 10 points per -1 to Fright Check</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You can unhinge the minds of others. There are many way this effect can manifest: a chilling howl, mind-warping body geometry, or even divine awe or unbearable beauty. When you activate this ability, anyone who sees you or hears you (choose one when you buy this trait) must roll an immediate Fright Check (see Fright Checks, p. 360).<br>
Modifiers: All applicable modifiers under Fright Check Modifiers (p. 360). You can buy extra penalties to this Fright Check for 10 points per -1 to the roll. Your victims get +1 per Fright Check after the first within 24 hours.<br>
If a victim succeeds at his Fright Check, he will be unaffected by your Terror for one hour.<br>
Add the Melee Attack limitation (p. 112) if your Terror affects only those you touch.<br>
Active: Your Terror doesn't affect everyone nearby - it's a direct mental attack on one victim. Your target must be within 10 yards (modified by Increased or Reduced Range), and able to see or hear you. You must take a Concentrate maneuver to affect him. Roll a Quick Contest of Will with your subject. He's at -1 for each -1 to Fright Checks you bought. If you win, roll 3d for the result, as usual, but add your margin of victory instead of his margin of failure. +0%.<br>
Presence: Your physical presence within 10 yards is enough to cause Fright Checks, even if your victims can neither see you nor hear you. You could be locked in a coffin and still terrify those who stray too close. Each level of Area Effect doubles your radius, but the GM should consider forbidding huge areas. +25%.<br>
<hr>
</p><h3 class="card">Special Limitations</h3><p class="card">
Always On: You cannot turn off your Terror to engage in normal social activities. This limitation often accompanies the extreme levels of Appearance - usually Hideous or worse, but possibly also Transcendent! -20%.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>TRAINED BY A MASTER</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>30 points</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You have been trained by - or are - a true master of the martial arts. Your exceptional talent means you have half the usual penalty to make a Rapid Strike (see Melee Attack Options, p. 370), or to parry more than once per turn (see Parrying, p. 376). These benefits apply to all your unarmed combat skills (Judo, Karate, etc.) and Melee Weapon skills.<br>
Furthermore, you can focus your inner strength (often called chi) to perform amazing feats! This permits you to learn Flying Leap, Invisibility Art, Power Blow, and many other skills - anything that requires this advantage as a prerequisite (see Chapter 4).<br>
The GM is free to set prerequisites for this advantage if he wishes. Common examples from fiction include Judo, Karate, Melee Weapon skills, Philosophy, and Theology. This ability is definitely larger than life. The GM may wish to forbid it in a realistic campaign.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>TRUE FAITH</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>15 points</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You have a profound religious faith that protects you from evil supernatural beings such as demons and vampires. To enjoy this protection, you must actively assert your faith by wielding a physical symbol revered by your religion (e.g., crucifix, Torah, or Koran), chanting, dancing, or whatever else is appropriate to your beliefs. If you wish to use this ability in combat - to repel zombies, for instance - then you must choose the Concentrate maneuver each turn, and can do nothing else.<br>
For as long as you assert your faith, no malign supernatural entity (GM's judgment as to what this covers) may approach within one yard of you. If one is forced into this radius, it must leave by the most direct route possible, as if it suffered from Dread (p. 132). If it cannot leave without coming closer, it must make a Will roll. On a success, it may run past you to escape, pushing you aside if necessary (but using only the minimum force required to escape). On a failure, the monster is cowed. It must cower, helplessly, and cannot move, defend itself, or take any other action.<br>
To keep True Faith, you must behave in a manner consistent with your religion. You will nearly always have to take and adhere to one or more of the traits listed under Self-Imposed Mental Disadvantages (p. 121). In effect, True Faith comes with a built-in Pact limitation (p. 113); do not apply this modifier again. You do not have to be kind, loving, or law-abiding, however. A violent bigot or religious terrorist can be just as sincere in his religious devotion as a saintly ascetic.<br>
True Faith (Chosen): You enjoy all the benefits of True Faith, but your power is due to the fact that your god has chosen to act through you - possibly without your consent. Barring egregious transgressions, your advantage functions regardless of your actual faith. This comes at a cost, however: non-supernatural servitors of rival deities can sense your special status and react to you at -3 . . . and your True Faith can't repel these foes. 15 points.<br>
Turning: You can aggressively turn the entities your True Faith repels. Take a Concentrate maneuver and roll a Quick Contest of Will with any such being that can see you. Roll just once for hordes of identical monsters with the same Will. Any creature you win or tie against can't move any closer to you than yards equal to your margin of victory (minimum one yard). If it's inside that radius, it must flee as described for unmodified True Faith. This effect endures for as long as you concentrate and for 1d seconds after you stop. +65%.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>TUNNELING</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>30 points + 5 points per point of Tunneling Move</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You can bore through earth and stone, spewing rubble behind you. The passage you dig is wide enough for you to walk through. You move through stone at half normal Tunneling Move. The GM may wish to assess a chance that your tunnel collapses behind you. Roll each minute vs. the highest of Engineer (Mining), Prospecting-3, and IQ-4 to dig a stable tunnel. This can be modified upward for hard rock and downward for soft rock or loose earth. Each halving of your Tunneling Move gives +1 on this roll.<br>
Hands-Free: You dig with a special body part, disintegrator ray, etc. that leaves all of your hands available to hold things as you tunnel. +20%.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>ULTRAHEARING</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>0 or 5 points</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You can hear sounds in the frequencies above the normal range of human hearing (20 kHz). This allows you to hear dog whistles, sonar, motion detectors, etc. You can detect active sonar at twice its effective range. Cost depends on your capabilities:<br>
You can hear only high-frequency sounds: 0 points.<br>
You can hear high-frequency sounds and other sounds: 5 points.<br>
This advantage is included in Ultrasonic Speech, below; if you have Ultrasonic Speech, you cannot take this as well (but don't need to).</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>ULTRASONIC SPEECH</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>0 or 10 points</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You can converse in the ultrasonic range. This advantage includes Ultrahearing, above. Note that many creatures find it intensely annoying or even painful to be within earshot of sustained ultrasonic pitches! Cost depends on your capabilities:<br>
You can only communicate via Ultrasonic Speech: 0 points.<br>
You can switch between regular speech and Ultrasonic Speech at will: 10 points.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>ULTRAVISION</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>0 or 10 points</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You can see ultraviolet light (UV). Solar UV is present outdoors during the day, even under cloud cover, but is stopped by window glass or any solid barrier (earth, stone, etc.). Fluorescent lamps also emit UV. Provided UV is present, you can make out more colors than those with normal vision. This helps you discern outlines; spot trace quantities of dust, dyes, etc.; and identify minerals and plants. You get +2 to all Vision rolls made in the presence of UV, as well as to all Forensics, Observation, and Search rolls to spot clues or hidden objects.<br>
At night, a small amount of UV reaches the ground from the stars. This doesn't let you see in the dark, but it does let you ignore -2 in darkness penalties (cumulative with Night Vision). UV penetrates farther underwater than visible light. This lets you halve all vision penalties underwater (but in total darkness, you are as blind as anyone else).<br>
Cost depends on your capabilities:<br>
You can only see UV, and are blind indoors, underground, or anywhere else there is no UV, even when there are normal light sources present: 0 points.<br>
You can see both visible light and UV: 10 points.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>UNAGING</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>15 points</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You never grow old naturally and cannot be aged unnaturally. Your age is fixed at any point you choose and will never change. You never have to make aging rolls.<br>
<hr>
</p><h3 class="card">Special Enhancements</h3><p class="card">
Age Control: You can age in either direction at will, at up to 10 times the normal rate. +20%.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>UNFAZEABLE</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>15 points</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>Nothing surprises you - at least, nothing that's not obviously a threat. The world is full of strange things, and as long as they don't bother you, you don't bother them.<br>
You are exempt from Fright Checks, and reaction modifiers rarely affect you either way. You treat strangers with distant courtesy, no matter how strange they are, as long as they're well-behaved. You have the normal reaction penalty toward anyone who does something rude or rowdy, but you remain civil even if forced to violence. Intimidation (p. 202) just does not work on you.<br>
You are not emotionless - you just never display strong feelings. The stereotypical aged kung fu master or English butler has this trait.<br>
You must roleplay this advantage fully, or the GM can declare that it has been lost. In a campaign where Fright Checks are an hourly occurrence, the GM can charge 20 points - or more! - or disallow Unfazeable altogether. This advantage is incompatible with all Phobias.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>UNIVERSAL DIGESTION</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>5 points</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You have remarkably adaptable digestive processes that let you derive nutrition from any nontoxic animal or plant protein, no matter how alien or fantastic. This enables you to subsist on things that would normally be harmless but non-nutritious. You have no special resistance to poison, though; for that, buy Resistant (p. 80).<br>
Matter Eater: You can eat anything (organic or inorganic), even if it's corrosive, toxic, or radioactive. Your body instantly disintegrates it or converts it to something harmless - you could even digest a live grenade to prevent it from detonating! Only your digestive system is safe from harm, though. Without protective advantages, it can be tricky to get nasty stuff like nerve agents and plutonium to your mouth without touching it with your hands, breathing it, or being irradiated. You can't eat antimatter. +300%.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>UNKILLABLE</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>50 to 150 points</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You cannot be killed! You are subject to all the other effects of injury. You feel pain, your wounds slow you, and you can be stunned or knocked out. You lose the use of any limb that receives a crippling wound, and you might even lose the limb itself. You can even lose attribute levels, advantages, etc. to disease, injury, or poison. However, you will only die if your body is physically destroyed - and sometimes not even then.<br>
This advantage comes in three levels:<br>
Unkillable 1: Injury affects you normally, but you need never make a HT roll to stay alive. You can survive (and even function, if you remain conscious) down to -10xHP, at which point your body is physically destroyed and you die. As long as you are alive, you heal at your usual rate - typically 1 HP/day, modified for any Regeneration (p. 80) you may have. Crippled limbs do heal, but severed limbs are gone for good unless you have Regrowth (p. 80). 50 points.<br>
Unkillable 2: As Unkillable 1, but you do not die at -10xHP. Once you reach -10xHP, you are reduced to an indestructible skeleton and automatically fall unconscious. You sustain no further damage from any attack. Once the damage stops, you heal normally - even if you've been hacked to pieces - and any severed body parts will grow back. You regain consciousness once you have positive HP. Note that your enemies can imprison your remains while you are unconscious, or even expose them to a source of continuous damage (fire is a common choice) to prevent you from healing. 100 points.<br>
Unkillable 3: As Unkillable 2, except that at -10xHP, you become a ghost, an energy pattern, or some other incorporeal form that cannot be contained or damaged through normal means. At this stage, you fall unconscious and heal normally. Once you are at full HP, your fully intact body will coalesce in a location of the GM's choosing. 150 points.<br>
With the GM's permission, if you have Unkillable 2 or 3 and are taken to -10xHP, you can trade in Unkillable and use the points to buy a spirit or undead racial template (if such things exist in the setting), becoming a ghost, revenant, etc. once you heal all your HP.<br>
By default, you age normally, and will eventually die of old age. To be truly immortal, combine Unkillable with Unaging (above) - and possibly one or more of Doesn't Breathe (p.49), Injury Tolerance (p. 60), Regeneration (p. 80), and Resistant (p. 80).<br>
<hr>
</p><h3 class="card">Special Limitations</h3><p class="card">
Achilles' Heel: Damage from one particular source (possibly one to which you have a Vulnerability, p. 161) can kill you normally. You must make normal HT rolls to survive at -HP and below, and die automatically if this damage takes you below -5xHP. The limitation value depends on the rarity of the attack, as defined under Limited Defenses (p. 46): -10% if Rare, -30% if Occasional, or -50% if Common or Very Common.<br>
Hindrance: A specific substance (e.g., silver or wood) prevents healing - whether by natural means or Regeneration - for as long as it remains in your body. Once you pass out from your injuries, you stay dormant until this substance is removed. The limitation value depends on the rarity of the substance: -5% if Rare, -15% if Occasional, or -25% if Common.<br>
Reincarnation: This is only available for Unkillable 2 or 3. When reduced to -10xHP, you recover at your usual rate, but you wake up in an entirely new body with new abilities. The GM creates the new form (or may allow you to do so), but you always retain the Unkillable advantage. -20%.<br>
Trigger: This is only available for Unkillable 2 or 3. Once reduced to -10xHP, you require some substance (such as human blood) or condition (such as a ritual) before you will start to heal. Until then, you will remain dormant. The limitation value depends on the rarity of the trigger: -25% if Rare, -15% if Occasional, or -5% if Common or Very Common.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>UNUSUAL BACKGROUND</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>Variable</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>This is a catch-all trait that the GM can use to adjust the point total of any character with special abilities that are not widely available in the game world. Special abilities might mean cinematic traits, magic spells, exotic advantages (for a human), supernatural advantages (for anyone), or almost anything else - it depends on the setting. Players are free to suggest Unusual Backgrounds to the GM, but the GM decides whether a proposed Unusual Background is acceptable, and if so, what its cost and benefits are.<br>
Example 1: Raised by wizards to justify access to magic spells might be a 0-point special effect in a fantasy world where magic is common, a 10- point Unusual Background in a conspiracy campaign where magic is known but kept secret, and a 50-point Unusual Background - or simply forbidden - in a horror game where a PC who wields supernatural power would reduce the suspense.<br>
Example 2: Daughter of the God of Magic to justify the Unkillable advantage would be an Unusual Background in any setting, and would be worth as much as the advantage itself - 50 points or more - if the GM allowed it at all.<br>
Not every unusual character concept merits an Unusual Background. The GM should only charge points when the character enjoys a tangible benefit. For instance, it would be unusual for a human to be raised by wolves, but unless this gave him special capabilities (such as Speak with Animals), it would be background color, worth 0 points.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>VACUUM SUPPORT</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>5 points</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You are immune to deleterious effects associated with vacuum and decompression (see Vacuum, p. 437). This advantage does not give you an air supply; buy Doesn't Breathe (p. 49) for that.<br>
Those with Vacuum Support usually have the Sealed advantage (p. 82), and often have Radiation Tolerance (p. 79) and Temperature Tolerance (p. 93), but none of these traits are required.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>VAMPIRIC BITE</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>30 points + 5 points per extra HP drained</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You can bite people and drain their life force, healing your own wounds in the process. You can only feed if your victim is helpless (pinned, stunned, unconscious, etc.), grappled, or willing. If he is wearing armor, your biting damage must penetrate its DR. Once you've bitten through your victim's DR, you can drain 1 HP per second from him. For every 3 HP stolen, you heal 1 HP or 1 FP (your choice). You cannot raise your HP or FP above normal this way.<br>
The basic Vampiric Bite described above costs 30 points. You may buy increased HP drain for 5 points per additional HP drained per second; for instance, to drain 10 HP per second, pay 75 points.<br>
Vampiric Bite also lets you bite in combat without feeding. Treat this as Teeth (Sharp Teeth) or Teeth (Sharp Beak) (p. 91) - your choice. You do not need to purchase that advantage separately.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>VERSATILE</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>5 points</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You are extremely imaginative. You get a +1 bonus on any task that requires creativity or invention, including most rolls against Artist skill, all Engineer rolls for new inventions, and all skill rolls made to use the Gadgeteer advantage.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>VIBRATION SENSE</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>10 points</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You can detect the location and size of objects by sensing vibrations with your skin, whiskers, or antennae. You must specify whether this ability works in the air or in the water.<br>
Vibration Sense is not a substitute for vision. You can locate an opponent in the dark, but you cannot detect details (e.g., whether he is armed). In a perfectly still, dark chamber, you would have only a vague notion of the size of the area, but you would be able to sense a barrier before you ran into it, and could find openings by sensing the flow of air or water.<br>
To use Vibration Sense, make a Sense roll. Consult the Size and Speed/Range Table (p. 550) and apply separate bonuses for the target's size and speed, and a penalty for the range to the target. Wind (in air) or swift currents (in water) will generate noise that interferes with your sense. Find the speed of the wind or current on the table and assess the relevant speed penalty.<br>
A successful roll reveals the rough size, location, speed, and direction of movement of the target. It does not provide any information about the object's shape, color, etc. Once you have detected something, you may target it with an attack. The modifiers that applied to your Sense roll also apply to your attack roll, but can never give you a bonus to hit.<br>
Note that if you are outside the element (air or water) where your ability functions, or if you are wearing a sealed suit, this ability does not work at all!<br>
Universal: Your Vibration Sense works both in the air and in the water. +50%.<br>
Sense of Perception: Your ability doesn't depend on air or water currents tickling hairs or your skin. You detect vibrations by virtue of a sixth sense (e.g., psychokinetic feedback). This works even when you're in a sealed suit or a vacuum, and isn't subject to interference by environmental noise. This gives all the benefits of Universal; there's no need to take both enhancements. +100%.<br>
Targeting: By taking an Aim maneuver, you can lock onto anything you've already detected and determine its precise range and speed, exactly as if you had a technological rangefinder. This gives you +3 to hit that target with an aimed ranged attack. +20%.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>VISUALIZATION</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>10 points</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You can improve your chances at a task by visualizing yourself successfully performing it. The closer your mental picture is to the actual circumstances, the greater the bonus. The visualization must be detailed and must involve a clear and specific action. This makes it useless in combat, where the situation changes faster than you can visualize it.<br>
To use this talent, you must concentrate for one minute. You, the player, must describe the scene you visualize (which can include senses other than sight) and the results you hope to achieve. Then make an IQ roll.<br>
You get a +1 bonus to the action you visualized for every point by which you succeed - if the circumstances correspond almost exactly to the visualization. If they are not quite the same, which will almost always be true, halve the bonus (minimum +1). And if something is clearly different, divide the bonus by 3 (no minimum). The GM can assess a further bonus of up to +2, or a penalty of any size, for a good or bad description!<br>
Blessing: You can improve the odds of success of any task undertaken by a sapient being just by thinking good thoughts for a minute beforehand. You must be able to see or touch the beneficiary. When he rolls for his task, he gains the Visualization bonus. You can only have one bonus pending at a time - for yourself or someone else - but you can cancel this to assist another task. +100% if you can affect your rolls and those of others; +0% if you can aid others but not yourself.<br>
Cursing: You can project negative energy to reduce others' odds of success. You must be able to see or touch your victim for a full minute while you visualize him failing at his task. Without special abilities of his own, he won't know that you're cursing him. When he carries out his task, he suffers a penalty equal in size to your usual bonus. You can only have one curse active at a time, but you can cancel it to curse another task. Your advantage doesn't affect you at all, and you can't combine Cursing with Blessing. If you can also produce beneficial effects, buy Visualization a second time without Cursing, and possibly with Blessing. +100%.</p,></div></div>

<div><p class='card'>You have a naturally clear, resonant, and attractive voice.

<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>WALK ON AIR</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>20 points</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>Air, smoke, and other gases are like solid ground beneath your feet, allowing you to walk up and down invisible stairs at your ground Move. This won't work in a vacuum - there has to be some kind of air present. If you get knocked down or slip, you fall! You may attempt one DX roll per second of falling. If you succeed, you stop in thin air, unharmed. Otherwise, you hit the ground for normal falling damage (see Falling, p. 431).<br>
Lighter Than Air: Your ability works by making you lighter than air or gaseous. Wind moves you a yard per second in the direction it's blowing per 5 mph of wind speed. -10%.<br>
Maximum Height: You can't walk very high off the ground. A 30-foot limit is -10%; a 10-foot limit is -20%; and a 5-foot limit is -25%.<br>
Planetary: You push off against a planet's gravity field or walk along its magnetic field lines. Your ability is useless in the absence of a planet. -5%.<br>
Vertical Only: You can only climb straight up, as if using a ladder made of air. You can't move laterally at all. -25%.</p,></div></div>

<div><h2 class='points'>15 points</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You can walk on the surface of any liquid as if it were solid ground. You move at your usual ground Move. This doesn't protect you from any damage that you would take from coming into contact with the liquid, however. You can't traverse volcanic lava or boiling acid without taking damage!<br>
Submerged: You can walk while under liquid, too. Use the rules for Walk on Air, but a fall just means you're swimming instead of walking. +20%.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>WARP</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>100 points</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You have the ability to teleport, traveling from point to point without moving through the intervening space. To do so, you must be able to see your destination with your own eyes, or view it remotely (via closed-circuit TV, someone else's eyes using Mind Reading with the Sensory enhancement, etc.), or visualize it clearly (which is only possible if you have visited it previously in person).<br>
You can carry up to Basic Lift when you travel, plus any Payload (p. 74). To carry more, or to bring along other people, take the Extra Carrying Capacity enhancement (below).<br>
Make an IQ roll to activate your ability, modified as follows:<br>
Distance: Distance penalties appear on the table below. If actual distance falls between two values, use the higher.<br>

This table is not open-ended; +10 is the maximum possible bonus.<br>
Removal: If you have a secondhand view of the destination, you are at -2 per level of removal. For instance, seeing it on TV or through someone else's eyes would give -2, while seeing it on a television set that you are viewing through someone else's eyes would give -4. There is an additional -2 to teleport to a place you have visited but cannot see.<br>
Fatigue Points: Apply a bonus of +1 per FP spent. You must declare this before you roll, and you lose the FP whether you succeed or fail. You never have to spend FP, but it is usually a good idea if you must travel far or without much preparation.<br>
On a success, you appear at your target destination. On a failure, you go nowhere and strain your power: you are at -5 to use it again in the next 10 minutes. On a critical failure, you arrive at the wrong destination. This can be anywhere the GM wishes! It need not be dangerous, but it should seriously inconvenience you. In addition, your power temporarily burns out and will not function again for 1d hours.<br>
You can use Warp to evade attacks in combat. Once per turn, you may teleport to any location you can see within 10 yards, instantly. This is considered a dodge. Of course, the IQ roll will be at -10 for instant use, so you might want to spend FP to improve your odds!<br>
You can improve this ability with practice, spending points to add enhancements or remove limitations. You cannot take Reduced Fatigue Cost or Reduced Time (p. 108); instead, take Reliable (below) so that you will need less time or fewer FP to teleport reliably.<br>
Gate: Mystics and ritualists with Warp traditionally open swirling vortices or glowing portals that anyone can step through. A teleporter who can do this requires Tunnel (+40% or +100%) - plus Extra Carrying Capacity, Extra-Heavy (+50%), if he and his companions can bring along anything they can lift. Those who draw magical circles should add Preparation Required, 1 minute (-20%), while those who activate existing artifacts need Special Portal (from -20% for mirrors to -80% for a tiny number of sites of ancient power).<br>
Matter Transmission (MT): Cyborgs, robots, and vehicles can have superscience MT devices built in. Most have orbital range and require the user to set coordinates, giving Range Limit (-5%) and Blind Only (-50%). Some transmitters let the user bring along anything he can carry (Extra Carrying Capacity, Extra- Heavy, +50%); others, especially implants, send only his body (Naked, -30%). High-quality technology grants No Strain (+25%), Reliable (+5% per +1), or both. Experimental prototypes, on the other hand, tend to have Drift (-15%).<br>
Psionic Teleportation: Psionic teleporters can typically specify range and direction, and track psychic residues left by other teleporters. These capabilities call for Blind (+50%) and Tracking (+20%). Weak psis often have Range Limit; for a range of less than 10 yards, take Reduced Range and Range Limit, -50%. Stronger psis enjoy Extra Carrying Capacity and Reliable. Astral travelers need Projection (-0%), and use Astral Projection - not Psionic Teleportation - as their power modifier (either is -10%).<br>
Stardrive: Some vehicles and supers vanish from one location and appear at another by moving through a realm where faster-than-light (FTL) travel is possible. This calls for Hyperjump (-25% or -50%). Most FTL drives either demand precise coordinates (Blind Only, -50%) or require a stargate (Special Portal, -40%). However, the predictability of stardrives tends to offset these limitations, giving No Strain (+25%), Reliable +5 to +10 (+25% to +50%), and/or Tracking (+20%).<br>
Super-Teleportation: Supers and gods with Warp generally use it as if it were second nature. Most have Blink (+25%), No Strain (+25%), Reliable, and no limitations other than a power modifier - although combat teleports are sometimes short-ranged, with Range Limit, 10 yards (-50%). Adept supers often have a lot of Extra Carrying Capacity. They can grapple enemies and teleport with them, but this requires an Attack followed by a Ready to activate Warp, and the victim may try to break free in between.<br>
<hr>
</p><h3 class="card">Special Enhancements</h3><p class="card">
Blind: You can teleport to a specific set of coordinates (distance and direction) without seeing or having visited the destination. This gives you an extra -5 to your IQ roll! You must pay two FP per +1 bonus when using this enhancement. +50%.<br>
Extra Carrying Capacity: You can carry more than your Basic Lift. If your carrying capacity is high enough, you may transport one person with you. Light encumbrance is +10%; Medium, +20%; Heavy, +30%; Extra- Heavy, +50%.<br>
Reliable: Your power is stable and predictable. Each level of this enhancement gives +1 to the IQ roll to use this ability, allowing you to teleport with little preparation (e.g., in combat) or over long distances without spending as many FP to improve your odds. +5% per +1, to a maximum of +10.<br>
Warp Jump: This enhancement is only available if you have the Jumper advantage (p. 64). You must apply it to both Jumper and Warp. If you are both a time- and world-jumper, and wish to use Warp with both abilities, buy this enhancement twice. When you jump, you can simultaneously use Warp to appear anywhere at your destination. Two die rolls are necessary - one per ability - and it is possible for one to succeed while the other fails, or for both to fail. +10% per linked Jumper advantage.<br>
Blink: Your ability works reflexively in times of stress. Once per turn, you can dodge an attack by making an IQ roll without the -10 for lack of preparation. Roll randomly for direction. You appear in the first safe open space in that direction. If there's no place like that within 10 yards, you go nowhere and your dodge fails. Blink is triggered by fear and adrenaline; thus, it generally only works in combat, although the GM may let you roll in other dangerous situations. Blink is incompatible with Hyperjump. +25%.<br>
No Strain: You ability isn't vulnerable to strain and burnout. You still go nowhere on a failure - and somewhere else on a critical failure - but you can always make an immediate repeated attempt at no extra penalty, and your Warp advantage never burns out. +25%.<br>
Tracking: You can follow another teleporter. Apply all the usual modifiers to your roll, plus -1 per yard of distance between you and his departure point. The time since he teleported also affects your roll. Use the modifiers for preparation time but reverse the sign, giving from +10 if he just left to -10 if he left eight hours ago. Add a further -1 per doubling of time after that. If your quarry departed from the same point more than once, you can only follow his most recent trip. Success means you appear at his arrival point . . . even if he went somewhere bad due to a critical failure or Drift. Failure by 1 means you follow but suffer the effects of Drift. Greater failure works as usual for Warp. +20%.<br>
Tunnel: Using your ability always creates a portal of about your size, which lingers for 3d seconds. Anyone may step through it. +40% if it forms after you teleport; +100% if it forms beforehand, and you must be free to move to use it but don't have to go through at all (the GM may allow this version for Jumper and Permeation, too).<br>
<hr>
</p><h3 class="card">Special Limitations</h3><p class="card">
Hyperjump: You physically move through hyperspace or jump space to journey between destinations. This is not true, instantaneous teleportation; you have an effective speed, which means the trip takes time. On long trips, you will need to address life-support needs! In addition, you cannot activate Hyperjump in atmosphere and you cannot travel distances shorter than one light-second (186,000 miles, -10 to IQ). This effectively limits you to space travel. There is one benefit to Hyperjump: if you possess Navigation (Hyperspace) skill, you may substitute it for IQ. -50% if your effective speed is the speed of light (every 186,000 miles traveled takes one second); -25% if you can travel one light-year (-17 to IQ) per day.<br>
Naked: You can carry nothing when you teleport! You always arrive naked. -30%.<br>
Psionic Teleportation: Your ability is part of the Teleportation psi power (see p. 257). -10%.<br>
Range Limit: You cannot teleport more than a certain distance per hop. Choose a range and find its distance penalty above. The limitation is worth -5% x (10 + penalty); e.g., 10 yards (-0) would be -50%, while 100 miles (-6) would be -20%. A range limit of more than 100,000 miles is not a meaningful limitation.<br>
Anchored: You can only teleport to a specific site or item (e.g., a magical beacon). You can't go anywhere else. This is incompatible with all special modifiers except Extra Carrying Capacity, Naked, No Strain, and Reliable. -50% if you teleport to a single site, but can switch this by physically visiting a new site for a minute; -60% if you teleport to a specific item that you can physically move from location to location, but that enemies could steal or place in danger; -80% for a single, fixed site.<br>
Blind Only: You must teleport to a set of coordinates exactly as if using the Blind enhancement, even if you can see or visualize your destination. Thus, you're always at -5, and each +1 costs 2 FP. Blind Only is mutually exclusive with Blind. -50%.<br>
Drift: You never arrive right on target. You appear at a random location somewhere in a circle with a radius equal to 1% of the distance you teleported (minimum one yard); e.g., if you teleported 10 miles, you'd materialize somewhere in a 0.1-mile circle around your target. The better your IQ roll, the closer you'll be to your target, but it's up to the GM exactly where you appear. On a critical failure, you're likely to appear high in the air or underground. -15%.<br>
Projection: You teleport your mind as a ghost while your body stays behind. See the Projection limitation under Jumper (p. 58) for details. Projection is incompatible with Extra Carrying Capacity, Naked, and Tunnel.<br>
Special Portal: You need a particular sort of gateway to use your advantage. The value depends on the rarity of the required portal (GM's decision). Any reflective surface is -20%; manmade stargates in every important star system are -40%; and a handful of ancient stone circles that only work a few nights of the year are -80%.</p,></div></div>

Dead Broke: You have no job, no source of income, no money, and no property other than the clothes you are wearing. Either you are unable to work or there are no jobs to be found. -25 points.<br>
Poor: Your starting wealth is only 1/5 of the average for your society. Some jobs are not available to you, and no job you find pays very well. -15 points.<br>
Struggling: Your starting wealth is only 1/2 of the average for your society. Any job is open to you (you can be a Struggling doctor or movie actor), but you don’t earn much. This is appropriate if you are, for instance, a 21st-century student. -10 points.<br>

<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>WEAPON MASTER</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>Variable</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You have a high degree of training or unnerving talent with a particular class of muscle-powered weapons (swords, bows, etc. - not guns). Available classes are:<br>
All muscle-powered weapons. 45 points.<br>
A large class of weapons. Examples: all bladed weapons, all onehanded weapons. 40 points.<br>
A medium class of weapons. Examples: all swords, all ninja weapons. 35 points.<br>
A small class of weapons. Examples: fencing weapons (maingauche, rapier, saber, and smallsword), knightly weapons (broadsword, mace, shield, and lance). 30 points.<br>
Two weapons normally used together. Examples: broadsword and shield, rapier and main-gauche. 25 points.<br>
One specific weapon. 20 points.<br>
In all cases, if a weapon can be thrown, the benefits of this advantage also apply when throwing that weapon.<br>
When using a suitable weapon, add +1 per die to basic thrust or swing damage if you know the relevant weapon skill at DX+1. Add +2 per die if you know that skill at DX+2 or better. You also have half the usual penalty to make a Rapid Strike (see Melee Attack Options, p. 369), or to parry more than once per turn (see Parrying, p. 376). None of these benefits apply to default use.<br>
You are familiar with - if not proficient in - every weapon within your class. This gives you an improved default: DX/Easy weapon skills default to DX-1, DX/Average ones to DX-2, and DX/Hard ones to DX-3. Note that these skills are no easier to learn, and may not be bought up from the improved defaults in order to save points.<br>
Finally, you may learn any cinematic skill that names this advantage as a prerequisite (see Chapter 4) - e.g., Blind Fighting and Power Blow - if you could reasonably use that skill with your weapons of choice. The GM is the final arbiter in all cases.<br>
This trait is best suited to a cinematic swashbuckling game. The GM may wish to forbid it in a realistic campaign.</p,></div></div>
<div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>WILD TALENT</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>20 points/level</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You can simply do things without knowing how. Once per game session per level of this advantage, you may attempt a roll against any skill, using your score in the appropriate attribute: IQ for IQ-based skills, DX for DX-based skills, etc. You do not incur any default penalties, but situational and equipment modifiers apply normally, as do any modifiers for advantages or disadvantages. Tech level is irrelevant: a TL3 monk could make an IQ roll to use Computer Programming/TL12!<br>
Wild Talent does apply to skills that normally have no default, provided you meet any advantage requirements. For instance, you could cast unknown magic spells provided you had Magery, or use unknown cinematic martial-arts skills provided you have Trained By A Master.<br>
Wild Talent has no effect on skills you already know.<br>
Hidden Gifts: Wild Talent could be a spontaneous manifestation of unrealized natural aptitude - or skills from a past life. Under stress, these gifts emerge in what's usually a learning experience. Take Retention (+25%), Emergencies Only (-30%), and Focused (-20%) in the area of aptitude. A natural spell-caster with Magery needs Focused, Magical, while someone who uses Reawakened (p. B80) to recall past lives has Focused, Past Lives.<br>
Telepresence: Someone with Digital Mind or the Machine meta-trait might be able to ask a remote operator with useful skills to take control of his body for the duration of a task. He remains aware of what his body is doing, but he has no access to his operator's knowledge. Add External (-20%), and use Focused (-20%) to limit skills to those known by the remote operator(s).<br>
<hr>
</p><h3 class="card">Special Enhancements</h3><p class="card">
Retention: You can learn the skills you use! To do so, you must have one unspent character point available when you attempt the skill roll. On a success, you may buy the skill at the one-point level. You cannot improve a skill learned this way for one month, during which time you use it at -2. On a critical success, you can start improving the skill immediately, and there is no -2. On a failure, you cannot learn the skill; on a critical failure, you also lose your unspent character point! Regardless of success, if you lack any of the skill's prerequisites, your skill is at -4 until you acquire them, and you cannot improve the skill in the interim. This enhancement does not let you learn skills from a TL higher than your own. +25%.<br>
Wild Ability: Only for those with powers. In addition to unknown skills, you can use abilities you don't have. Any such ability must be part of one of your powers, and can't have modifiers other than those required by the power it belongs to (for instance, its power modifier). You get one use of the ability - which means exactly what it does for Limited Use (p. B112). If the ability comes in dice or levels, you produce effects equal to one level or 30 points worth, whichever is better. +50%.<br>
<hr>
</p><h3 class="card">Special Limitations</h3><p class="card">
Emergencies Only: Your Wild Talent only works in life-threatening situations, such as mortal combat. To use it, you must ask for a particular result related to your predicament. Your request must be specific (e.g., Get him away from me.), but you cannot specify a skill (e.g., Use Judo or Cast the Command spell). The GM will then choose a skill that could bring about the desired result. He is not limited to mundane skills; he may choose a spell if you have Magery, a cinematic martial-arts skill if you have Trained By A Master, and so forth. Once the GM has chosen, roll against the governing attribute, as usual. If the GM feels you already have skills equal to the task, he will advise you on which skill to use. This still counts as one of your uses of Wild Talent! -30%.<br>
Focused: You can only use (and if you have Retention, learn) one specific class of skills. Options include Mental (mundane skills based on IQ, Perception, or Will), Physical (mundane skills based on ST, DX, or HT), Magical (spells), and Chi (cinematic martial-arts skill). -20%.<br>
External: Some remote party communicates the necessary skills to you. Specify whether they use radio, telepathy, or something else (for ideas, see Telecommunication, p. B91). Enemies might be able to jam the signal, compromise the person at the other end, etc. -20%.</p,></div></div>

<div><p class='card'>You do not officially exist. Even the highest authorities in the land know nothing about you. In a fantasy setting, you are a mysterious wanderer; magical divination cannot discover conclusive details about your past or true identity. In a high-tech world, you don't appear in the public records - and if computer databases exist, they contain no evidence of your existence. You must provide a reason for this; e.g., your parents hid you away at birth, you are legally dead, or you somehow managed to destroy all the records (explain how!).<br>
To maintain this status, you must deal strictly in cash or commodities. Credit and bank accounts must be blind (keyed to pass-code, not a person - the Swiss bank account) or set up through a Temporary Identity (see p. 31).<br>
If the authorities investigate you, they will initially assume that there has been an error. They will become increasingly concerned as no information can be found about your life. Eventually, they will attempt to apprehend you. If they can't find you, then they're likely to give up. But if they catch you, you are in for a thorough interrogation, possibly involving torture, mind probes, or worse. After all, a nonperson has no rights . . . and it will be very difficult for your allies to prove that you are being held, as you don't officially exist!</p,></div></div></body>
