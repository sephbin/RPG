<div><h2 class='points'>40 points</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You are invisible. Unlike most advantages, this one is always on unless you take a special enhancement. You still make noise, leave footprints, and have a scent - and by default, anything you carry remains visible. If you are carrying nothing, you get a +9 to Stealth in any situation where being seen would matter.<br>
Individuals using paranormal remote viewing (crystal balls, Clairvoyance, etc.) cannot see you if you would be invisible to their normal vision. Devices with these powers can still sense you, as can paranormal abilities that detect enemies, life, and so on nonvisually.<br>
Invisibility only works against one sort of vision. Types include electromagnetic vision (which encompasses ordinary vision, Infravision, Ultravision, and radar), sonar, magnetic fields, and anything else the GM comes up with. If you are invisible to electromagnetic vision, you do not cast a shadow and don't show up in mirrors.<br>
Deception: A ninja or telepath who mentally compels others to believe they can't see him has Invisibility to electromagnetic vision with Can Carry Objects, Switchable, and Glamour (p. 111). Deceivers aware of unusual senses might interfere with those, too; add Extended (+20%/type).<br>
Ghost: Ghosts that are invisible to mortals have Invisibility to electromagnetic vision with Usually On (+5%) and Substantial Only (-10%). Traditionally, ghosts can be seen in mirrors and photographs; they have Visible Reflection (-10%), and can't take Affects Machines.<br>
Stealth Technology: A vehicle or robot that's invisible to infrared and radar - but not the naked eye - has Invisibility to electromagnetic vision with Machines Only (-50%). The best optical camouflage has Affects Machines (+50%) instead of Machines Only, but still suffers from Fringe (-10%). Stealthy submarines have unmodified Invisibility to sonar; the best add Extended, Magnetic Detection (+20%). Switchable is uncommon, as stealth tends to be a permanent structural feature.<br>
Superscience Cloaking: Spaceopera cloaking devices give Invisibility to electromagnetic vision with Affects Machines (+50%), Extended, Scanners (+20%), and Switchable (+10%).<br>

Affects Machines: You are invisible even to machines. You cannot be photographed, and you don't show up on cameras or other detectors. Devices such as pressure plates still notice you, but you could walk past a robot sentry undetected. Electronically targeted weapons get no bonuses to hit you. +50%.<br>
Can Carry Objects: The objects you carry, including clothing and armor, become invisible. They regain visibility when put down. No encumbrance is +10%; Light, +20%; Medium, +50%; Heavy, +100%.<br>
Extended: You are invisible to more than one type of vision (for instance, electromagnetic vision and magnetic fields). +20% per additional type of vision.<br>
Switchable: You are normally visible, but can become invisible at will. +10%.<br>
Usually On: You are normally invisible, but can become visible for short periods with great effort. Turning visible costs 1 FP per second. +5%.<br>
Fringe: Your ability leaves a faint outline or shimmering. It works normally when you're standing still, but if you move, others can spot you with a Vision-6 roll and target you in combat at only -6 to hit. -10%.<br>

</p><h3 class="card">Special Limitations</h3><p class="card">
Machines Only: Similar to Affects Machines, but you are only invisible to machines. Living beings can see you normally. -50%.<br>
Substantial Only: Your invisibility only hides you in the material world. Insubstantial beings (ghosts, etc.) can see you normally. -10%.<br>
Visible Reflection: You can be seen in mirrors! -10%.<br>
Visible Shadow: You cast a shadow! -10%.</p,></div></div></body>
