<div><p class='card'>You have a natural ability to impress and lead others. Anyone can acquire a semblance of charisma through looks, manners, and intelligence - but real charisma is independent of these things. Each level gives +1 on all reaction rolls made by sapient beings with whom you actively interact (converse, lecture, etc.); +1 to Influence rolls (see Influence Rolls, p. 359); and +1 to Fortune-Telling, Leadership, Panhandling, and Public Speaking skills. The GM may rule that your Charisma does not affect members of extremely alien races.</p,></div></div></body>
