<body><div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>INDEPENDENT INCOME</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>1 point/level</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You have a source of income that does not require you to work: stock portfolio, trust fund, rental property, royalties, pension, etc. Your monthly income is 1% of your starting wealth (adjusted for wealth level) per level of this trait, to a maximum of 20%. If your income derives from investments, you need not specify their value; this trait assumes that you cannot or will not invade your capital.<br>
This trait is unrelated to wealth level. A Filthy Rich heiress has Independent Income . . . but so do an Average pensioner and a Poor welfare recipient.<br>
Independent Income most often means your occupation is something like dilettante, retiree, or welfare recipient – not an actual “job.” However, you can have Independent Income and a job; just add the income from both sources. If you are wealthy, this allows you to work less than full time (e.g., 10 hours per week instead of 40, for 1/4 the usual salary) and still make a good living.</p,></div></div></body>
