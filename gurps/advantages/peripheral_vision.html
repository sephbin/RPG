<div><h2 class='points'>15 points</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You have an unusually wide field of vision. You can see a 180° arc in front of you without turning your head, and have 30° of peripheral vision to either side of that. This gives you a 240° arc of vision for observation and ranged attacks. The figure above [[pic]] shows the arc of vision for a normal character (white) and for someone with Peripheral Vision (gray plus white).<br>
If you are playing with a battle map, you can make melee attacks into side (right and left) hexes as well as front hexes - although a onehanded attack to the opposite side (e.g., attacking your left hex with your right hand) is clumsy and considered a Wild Swing (see p. 388). You still cannot attack a foe directly behind you except with a Wild Swing.<br>
This also helps on defense! If you are attacked from a side hex, you defend at no penalty. Even against attacks from the rear, your active defense is only at -2.<br>
Out of combat, you get +3 to all rolls to detect Shadowing attempts or ambushes from behind, and the GM will always make a Vision roll for you to spot dangers behind your back.<br>

Easy to Hit: Your eyes are on stalks, unusually large, or otherwise more vulnerable to attack. Others can target your eyes from within their arc of vision at only -6 to hit. -20%.</p,></div></div></body>
