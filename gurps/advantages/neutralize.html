<div><p class='card'>You can neutralize the psi powers of a single psionic individual. This is an active ability with an ongoing effect on the subject. It does not have to be psionic - it might represent a magical or high-tech way to drain psi abilities. To use Neutralize, you must touch the subject (requires an Attack maneuver) and win a Quick Contest of Will. If you succeed, you successfully neutralize all your victim's psionic powers (see Chapter 6) for a number of minutes equal to your margin of victory. This has no effect on the subject's psionic Talents. Once you have neutralized someone, you cannot affect him again until his power recovers. A critical failure with this ability cripples it for 1d hours.<br>

</p><h3 class="card">Special Enhancements</h3><p class="card">
Power Theft: When you successfully neutralize a psi, you acquire his powers! You gain all the psionic abilities you neutralized - including their enhancements and limitations - for the duration. You can't use Neutralize again until these powers wear off. +200%.<br>

</p><h3 class="card">Special Limitations</h3><p class="card">
One Power: You can only neutralize a specific psionic power; e.g., ESP or Telepathy. See Chapter 6 for a list of standard psi powers. -50%.</p,></div></div></body>
