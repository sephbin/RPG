<div><h2 class='points'>Variable</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You have a high degree of training or unnerving talent with a particular class of muscle-powered weapons (swords, bows, etc. - not guns). Available classes are:<br>
All muscle-powered weapons. 45 points.<br>
A large class of weapons. Examples: all bladed weapons, all onehanded weapons. 40 points.<br>
A medium class of weapons. Examples: all swords, all ninja weapons. 35 points.<br>
A small class of weapons. Examples: fencing weapons (maingauche, rapier, saber, and smallsword), knightly weapons (broadsword, mace, shield, and lance). 30 points.<br>
Two weapons normally used together. Examples: broadsword and shield, rapier and main-gauche. 25 points.<br>
One specific weapon. 20 points.<br>
In all cases, if a weapon can be thrown, the benefits of this advantage also apply when throwing that weapon.<br>
When using a suitable weapon, add +1 per die to basic thrust or swing damage if you know the relevant weapon skill at DX+1. Add +2 per die if you know that skill at DX+2 or better. You also have half the usual penalty to make a Rapid Strike (see Melee Attack Options, p. 369), or to parry more than once per turn (see Parrying, p. 376). None of these benefits apply to default use.<br>
You are familiar with - if not proficient in - every weapon within your class. This gives you an improved default: DX/Easy weapon skills default to DX-1, DX/Average ones to DX-2, and DX/Hard ones to DX-3. Note that these skills are no easier to learn, and may not be bought up from the improved defaults in order to save points.<br>
Finally, you may learn any cinematic skill that names this advantage as a prerequisite (see Chapter 4) - e.g., Blind Fighting and Power Blow - if you could reasonably use that skill with your weapons of choice. The GM is the final arbiter in all cases.<br>
This trait is best suited to a cinematic swashbuckling game. The GM may wish to forbid it in a realistic campaign.</p,></div></div></body>
