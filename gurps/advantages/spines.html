<body><div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>SPINES</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>1 or 3 points</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You have sharp spines, like those of a porcupine or an echidna, located on strategic parts of your body. This is defensive weaponry, intended to discourage attackers; you cannot use your Spines actively. However, you get a DX-4 roll to hit each foe in close combat with you once per turn, as a free action. Roll at +2 against foes who attacked you from behind. Those who grapple or slam you are hit immediately and automatically - and those who slam you take maximum damage!<br>
Short Spines: One or two inches long. Do 1d-2 impaling damage. Reach C. 1 point.<br>
Long Spines: One or two feet long. Do 1d impaling damage. Reach C. 3 points.</p,></div></div></body>
