<body><div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>FLEXIBILITY</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>5 or 15 points</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>Your body is unusually flexible.<br>
This advantage comes in two levels:<br>
Flexibility: You get +3 on Climbing rolls; on Escape rolls to get free of ropes, handcuffs, and similar restraints; on Erotic Art skill; and on all attempts to break free in close combat (see p. 391). You may ignore up to -3 in penalties for working in close quarters (including many Explosives and Mechanic rolls). 5 points.<br>
Double-Jointed: As above, but more so. You cannot stretch or squeeze yourself abnormally, but any part of your body may bend any way. You get +5 on Climbing, Erotic Art, and Escape rolls, and on attempts to break free. You may ignore up to -5 in penalties for close quarters. 15 points.</p,></div></div></body>
