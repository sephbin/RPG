<body><div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>HIGH PAIN THRESHOLD</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>10 points</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You are as susceptible to injury as anyone else, but you don't feel it as much. You never suffer a shock penalty when you are injured. In addition, you get +3 on all HT rolls to avoid knockdown and stunning - and if you are tortured physically, you get +3 to resist. The GM may let you roll at Will+3 to ignore pain in other situations.<br>
High Pain Threshold is included in Supernatural Durability (p. 89); if you have the latter advantage, you cannot take this one.</p,></div></div></body>
