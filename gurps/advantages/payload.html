<div><h2 class='points'>1 point/level</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You can carry cargo or occupants inside your body! This might be a superficial feature (e.g., a surgically implanted flesh pocket or a natural pouch like that of a kangaroo) or an actual internal compartment. The latter is not just for machines - a zombie might have a colony of spiders or snakes living in its body, for example.<br>
Each level of Payload lets you carry up to Basic Lift/10 lbs. inside you. Those without Injury Tolerance (Homogenous) (p. 60) or the Machine meta-trait (p. 263) should ask the GM's permission before taking more than five levels of Payload. You must allocate your Payload between cargo and occupants when you buy the advantage:<br>
Cargo: 20 lbs. of cargo space is roughly equal to one cubic foot of capacity. A typical car has about 10-20 cubic feet of storage space; a semitrailer has about 2,400 cf.<br>
Occupants: A human-sized being requires about 200 lbs. of capacity. For others, take average racial weight and increase it by 1/3. An actual cabin requires 10 times that weight. Your defensive advantages (DR, Sealed, etc.) also protect your occupants. If your occupants can control you, buy Controls separately - see Compartmentalized Mind (p. 43).<br>
Treat your Payload as part of your body, not as encumbrance or carried weight, when calculating Move and using advantages with limited carrying capacity, such as Invisibility, Jumper, and Warp.<br>
Machines that can push or pull large external loads - or pick them up and carry them with arms, cranes, etc. - have Lifting ST (p. 65), not Payload. Ordinary cars and trucks have Payload, but forklifts, tugboats, and the like should buy Lifting ST to represent their abilities.<br>

</p><h3 class="card">Special Limitations</h3><p class="card">
Exposed: Your Payload cannot be concealed and is not protected by your defensive advantages. You can apply this to any portion of your Payload. The main use of this limitation is to create motorcycles and similar unenclosed vehicles. -50%.</p,></div></div></body>
