<div><h2 class='points'>15 or 40 points</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You have access to the memories of your direct ancestors (or earlier software generations, for Digital Minds). This ability comes in two forms:<br>
Racial Memory (Passive): Your talent is vague and totally passive. The GM secretly makes an IQ roll for you in any situation that your ancestors might have encountered. On a success, you get a feeling of deja vu about the situation. It is up to you to interpret this. A critical success gives a vivid replay of ancient ancestral memories. On a failure, nothing happens. A critical failure results in a wrong impression. 15 points.<br>
Racial Memory (Active): You may use this advantage actively. If you want to know something, the GM first determines whether or not your ancestors knew the answer. Then he rolls against your IQ to see if you can gain access to the information. If your ancestors didn't have the answer and the roll succeeds, you will know that. On a critical failure, you will believe your ancestors didn't know, even if they really did. This requires one turn of absolute concentration (the GM may require more elaborate preparations to recall very ancient memories). 40 points.<br>
Immersive: Successful use of your ability gives you a replay of ancestral memories, similar to what those without this enhancement experience on a critical success. On Racial Memory (Passive), this removes the need for interpretation when you receive a vision. With Racial Memory (Active), you can replay your ancestors' lives at will! +50%.</p,></div></div></body>
