<div><p class='card'>You can converse using extremely low-frequency sounds. This trait includes Subsonic Hearing, above. Subsonic speech is slow (half-speed), and even if the frequency is shifted into the normal range, subsonic speakers are at -2 to Fast-Talk and any other skill where versatile speaking is important. However, subsonic speech carries twice as far as normal speech. Cost depends on your capabilities:<br>
You can only communicate via Subsonic Speech: 0 points.<br>
You can switch between regular speech and Subsonic Speech at will: 10 points.</p,></div></div></body>
