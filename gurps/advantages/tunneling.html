<div><h2 class='points'>30 points + 5 points per point of Tunneling Move</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You can bore through earth and stone, spewing rubble behind you. The passage you dig is wide enough for you to walk through. You move through stone at half normal Tunneling Move. The GM may wish to assess a chance that your tunnel collapses behind you. Roll each minute vs. the highest of Engineer (Mining), Prospecting-3, and IQ-4 to dig a stable tunnel. This can be modified upward for hard rock and downward for soft rock or loose earth. Each halving of your Tunneling Move gives +1 on this roll.<br>
Hands-Free: You dig with a special body part, disintegrator ray, etc. that leaves all of your hands available to hold things as you tunnel. +20%.</p,></div></div></body>
