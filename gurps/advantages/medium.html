<div><p class='card'>You can perceive and communicate with spirits - particularly spirits of the dead. You don't see them visually, but you know when they're nearby. You can speak with any spirit in your presence, provided you share a language. You can also call spirits to you; there is no guarantee that they will answer your summons, but they will hear it. Note that this trait does not give you a reaction bonus with spirits, or any power to control their behavior.<br>
Manifestation: Your presence makes it easier for spirits to become visible, if they wish. As long as they're within a yard of you, those with the Spirit meta-trait (p. B263) needn't pay the 1 FP per second demanded by the Usually On limitation on their Invisibility. +100%.<br>
Universal: You can communicate with any spirit you can sense with Medium, even those with whom you don't share a language. +50%.<br>
Visual: You can see spirits while communicating with them, even if they would normally be invisible. +50%.<br>
Specialized: Your ability only works with one specific class of spirits. Possibilities include angels, demons, elementals, faerie creatures, and ghosts. -50%.</p,></div></div></body>
