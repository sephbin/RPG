<div><h2 class='points'>50 points/level</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You radiate magical energy, or mana. Each level of Mana Enhancer (to a maximum of two) increases the local mana level by one step, but only for you and people or things that you're carrying. If more than one character with Mana Enhancer could increase the mana level, apply only the highest increase; do not add the effects together.<br>
This ability does not directly confer the ability to cast spells; for that, take Magery (p. 66). However, if you can raise the mana level to high or better, you can cast many spells without Magery! For details, see Mana (p. 235).<br>
This ability has its drawbacks: you cannot have Magic Resistance, and mages get an IQ + Magery roll to sense that you possess this trait. In some game worlds, this combination may force you to hide from unethical wizards!<br>
The GM should keep this trait under strict control, as it is powerful and easily abused in fantasy settings.<br>

</p><h3 class="card">Special Enhancements</h3><p class="card">
Area Effect: Your ability affects everything in an area centered on you. The first level of Area Effect gives you a radius of one yard. Each level after the first doubles this radius as usual; see Area Effect (p. 102). +50%/level.<br>
Switchable: You can switch this power off in order to deprive enemy wizards of its benefits (or simply to hide from them!). +100%.<br>
Discriminatory: You and any allies in your area of effect enjoy the best mana level your ability can provide - highest if casting spells, lowest if resisting them - while enemies in the area suffer the worst level you can generate. This modifier includes Switchable, and replaces the Selective Area enhancement for Mana Damper and Mana Enhancer. +150%.</p,></div></div></body>
