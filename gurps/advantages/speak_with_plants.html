<div><p class='card'>You can communicate empathically with plants. All earthly plants are IQ 0, but a large tree might be wiser than the average ivy, at the GM's whim. A plant might know how recently it was watered or walked on, or something else that directly bears on its well-being, but would be unable to relate an overheard phone conversation. Any normal plant will always cooperate, within the limits of its ability.<br>
Sapience: The plants you converse with function as if they had your IQ, as described for the enhancement of the same name under Speak With Animals (above). +40%.<br>
Specialized: You can only communicate with certain plants. All terrestrial plants (including all trees, bushes, and herbs) and All aquatic plants (including algae, kelp, and seaweed) are -40%; a large subset of either (e.g., Trees or Herbs), -50%; a smaller subset (e.g., Evergreens or Medicinal Herbs), -60%.</p,></div></div></body>
