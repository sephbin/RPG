<div><p class='card'>Something about you makes people pity you and want to take care of you.

Taken in conjunction with above-average looks, Pitiable means you are “cute” instead of “sexy”; in combination with below-average looks, it means you are “appealingly homely,” like a basset hound.</p,></div></div></body>
