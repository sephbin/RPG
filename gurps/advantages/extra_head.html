<div><p class='card'>You have more than one head, each with fully functional ears, eyes, mouth, etc. Each Extra Head gives you one Extra Mouth (p. 55) and one level of Enhanced Tracking (p. 53) at no extra charge. Each head also contains an extra brain with a complete copy of your memories, personality, and skills. These extra brains are backups, however, and do not grant additional mental actions - for that, take Compartmentalized Mind (p. 43). You cannot suffer more than 2 x (your HP/number of heads) points of injury from any single attack to your head or neck. Any head blow that causes unconsciousness only knocks out that one head; the others continue to function! A critical head blow that would normally kill you simply destroys that head, inflicting the maximum injury noted above and crushing, severing, or exploding the head (GM's option).<br>

Extraneous: Your Extra Head grants Extra Mouth and Enhanced Tracking, but does not contain a backup brain. A single blow to an Extraneous head can do no more than HP/(1.5 x number of heads) points of injury, but blows to your real head can cause stun, knockout, or death even if your other heads are unharmed. -20%.</p,></div></div></body>
