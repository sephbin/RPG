<body><div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>REGROWTH</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>40 points</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You can regrow lost limbs and organs! A lost ear, finger, toe, claw, tentacle tip, etc. regrows in 1d weeks; a lost hand or foot in 1d+1 months; and a lost eye, arm, or leg in 2d+2 months. If you also have Regeneration (above), Regrowth works much faster: all lost body parts regrow in the time it takes you to heal to full HP.<br>
Doubling: When you lose a body part, you can sprout two replacements, like the Hydra of myth! You must have enough unspent points to buy the relevant advantage (Extra Arm, Extra Head, etc.), and you must pay these points as soon as you lose the body part. Otherwise, you can only grow a single replacement. Regrowth occurs at the usual speed. +25% if this works with only one type of body part (arms, legs, heads, etc.); +50% if it works with any missing part.<br>
Reattachment: You can reattach any severed but intact body part by holding it in place for a minute. Regeneration reduces this to 30 seconds if Slow, three seconds if Regular, or one second if Fast or better (but Very Fast and Extreme typically remove the need for this enhancement). +50%.<br>

</p><h3 class="card">Special Limitations</h3><p class="card">
Minor: You can only regrow ears, fingers, toes, and other small bits - not hands, feet, eyes, etc. -50%.<br>
Bane: You can't regrow a body part if it's lost to injury from a particular source or if the stump is exposed to a specific substance (e.g., fire) - your choice. Limitation value depends on the rarity of the attack: -10% if Rare, -30% if Occasional, or -50% if Common or Very Common.<br>
Reattachment Only: You can only reattach body parts, as described for Reattachment, making your ability useless if the part is mangled, vaporized, eaten, etc. -50%.</p,></div></div></body>
