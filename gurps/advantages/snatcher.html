<body><div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>SNATCHER</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>80 points</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You have the power to find almost any small item you desire in an alternate world and snatch it across the dimensions to you. The items you snatch do not come from your own world, but from some nameless parallel; therefore, you can never intentionally take something away from a specific other person. Note that this talent does not allow you to visit alternate worlds in person - only to steal from them.<br>
To make a snatch, you must first concentrate for 10 seconds and clearly visualize the item you want. The item must be able to fit in one hand, and cannot weigh more than 5 lbs. You should have a hand free (if your hands are tied, you roll at -3), and others can see you making reaching motions with that hand.<br>
Next, make an IQ roll for the snatch attempt. If you are trying for information in any form, the GM makes this roll for you (see below). Regardless of IQ, a roll of 14 or more always fails.<br>
On a success, the desired item appears in your hand - or sitting within arm's reach, if you prefer. On a failure, you obtain nothing. On a critical failure, you snatched the wrong item! This item is not immediately dangerous unless you were trying for something dangerous.<br>
Regardless of success or failure, each snatch attempt costs 2 FP.<br>
<hr>
Items Available<br>
In theory, you can get anything. In practice, some things are so hard to find that it is little use trying for them. You have a good chance of getting any item that exists, or that ever existed, in your own world - or any reasonably similar item. If the desired item is unusual, the GM may apply a penalty to the IQ roll:<br>
Item is significantly different from anything that ever appeared in your own world: -1 or more (GM's option). You could visualize a perfect diamond, bright green, the size of a hen's egg, carved into the shape of a typewriter, but you might be rolling at -20!<br>
Item is unique or almost unique in any one world (e.g., the Hope Diamond): -3 or worse (GM's option).<br>
You cannot clearly visualize what you want: -4 or worse (GM's option). Even on a success, you might not get what you were really hoping for.<br>
You cannot get an item that works by natural laws wholly different from those in your world. For instance, if your world is nonmagical (or has no magic that you know of), you cannot snatch a magic item, because you are unable to visualize it properly; you would get a pretty but powerless mundane item. Similarly, if you are from a low-TL world, you could not get a laser pistol; you wouldn't be able to visualize it well, and your best effort would be a broken or toy gun. (A generous GM might bend this rule on a critical success . . . and then let the poor Snatcher try to figure out how to use his amulet or laser pistol without killing himself.)<br>
Information is not available except in the form of ordinary textbooks, reports, etc. You can grab a history book, but you can't ask for The Book of What Happens Next in My Adventure. Note that the GM makes the roll if information is requested. If the roll fails by 5 or more, the information comes from an alternate world with different history, physics, etc., and is wrong - maybe subtly, maybe not subtly at all!<br>
<hr>
Repeated Attempts<br>
If your snatch attempt is unsuccessful, you can immediately try to snatch the same or a similar object again. These repeated attempts are made at a cumulative -1 to the IQ roll. Each repeated attempt costs 4 FP instead of the usual 2 FP. To eliminate these penalties, wait one hour between attempts.<br>
The GM should be strict about attempts to circumvent this. For instance, a .45 pistol is not very different from a .357 pistol for the purpose of this advantage. Furthermore, ignore critical successes on repeated attempts made in quick succession. If the snatch being attempted is very difficult, there is little choice but to wait an hour between attempts.<br>
<hr>
Duration<br>
The objects you snatch remain until you voluntarily return them or use your Snatcher ability again. To keep objects indefinitely, take the Permanent enhancement (below).<br>
<hr>
</p><h3 class="card">Special Enhancements</h3><p class="card">
Permanent: Objects you snatch don't vanish when you use your ability again. The GM is free to forbid this enhancement, as it allows a single Snatcher to amass boundless wealth by snatching small, valuable objects. +300%.<br>
Creation: You don't take items from anywhere - you create them on the spot. You can get anything you've seen personally, and items sufficiently close to these things that you can visualize them. There are never any penalties for item type. You still can't get impossible items, you can only have one created item at a time unless you also take Permanent, and normal weight and size limits apply. +100%.<br>
Large Items: You're not bound by the restriction that the items you snatch must fit in one hand. They can be any size, as long as they're within your weight limit. Large items too heavy to lift always appear at arm's reach. +50%.<br>
More Weight: Your weight limit is higher than 5 lbs.<br>
{style=width:300px; background-color: #e8ffe7; margin: auto; border-collapse:collapse; text-align:center;<br>
!LimitCost Modifier<br>
 style=background-color: #ffffff;<br>
7 lbs. +5%<br>
10 lbs. +10%<br>
 style=background-color: #ffffff;<br>
15 lbs. +15%<br>
20 lbs. +20%<br>
 style=background-color: #ffffff;<br>
30 lbs. +25%<br>
50 lbs. +30%<br>
Each further +30% multiplies weight by 10 (e.g., a ton is +80%). If your weight limit exceeds your onehanded lift (2xBL), you must also take the Large Items enhancement.<br>
<hr>
</p><h3 class="card">Special Limitations</h3><p class="card">
Specialized: You can only grab a certain type of object, or cannot touch a certain class of thing. Examples: Only metal, -5%; Only money, -10%; Only weapons, -10%; Only information, -20%; No metal, -20%; Only blue things, -25%. The GM sets the limitation value using the guidelines under Accessibility (p. 110).<br>
Stunning: You are mentally stunned after a successful snatch. -10%.<br>
Unpredictable: On a failed IQ roll, you get something, but it isn't what you wanted. The worse the failure, the more different the item is. If you wanted a loaded pistol, failure by 1 might bring an unloaded pistol. Failure by 2 could mean a water pistol, failure by 3 a book on How to Shoot, and so on . . . with a critical failure bringing a live hand grenade. Any critical failure is dangerous, regardless of what you were looking for! -25%.<br>
Recall: You call existing objects to you across space or dimensions. These must be personal possessions. You could summon your sidearm - or even your battlesuit, with More Weight - but not someone else's belongings, let alone items you've merely heard of. This still requires 10 seconds, 2 FP, and an IQ roll, but no penalties apply. Recalled items remain indefinitely, as if you had physically retrieved them. As usual, you can send the items back at any time. Recall is incompatible with Creation, Permanent, and Unpredictable. -25%.<br>
Less Weight: Your weight limit is lower than 5 lbs.<br>
