<div><h2 class='points'>Variable</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You have claws. This advantage modifies all your hands and feet; there is no discount for claws on only some of your limbs. There are several variations:<br>
Blunt Claws: Very short claws, like those of a dog. Add +1 per die to the damage you inflict with a punch or kick; e.g., 2d-3 becomes 2d-1. 3 points.<br>
Hooves: Hard hooves, like those of a horse. Add +1 per die to the damage you inflict with a kick, and give your feet (only) +1 DR. 3 points.<br>
Sharp Claws: Short claws, like those of a cat. Change the damage you inflict with a punch or kick from crushing to cutting. 5 points.<br>
Talons: Longer claws - up to 12 long. Change the damage you inflict with a punch or kick from crushing to your choice of cutting or impaling (choose before you roll to hit). 8 points.<br>
Long Talons: Huge claws, like sword blades extending from your body! Treat these as Talons, but damage is +1 per die. 11 points.</p,></div></div></body>
