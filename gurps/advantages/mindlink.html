<body><div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>MINDLINK</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>Variable</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You have a permanent telepathic rapport with someone - often a twin, loved one, hive member, etc. You automatically succeed at all attempts to contact him with Telesend (see Telecommunication, p. 91) and Mind Reading (p. 69), provided he chooses not to resist or has Slave Mentality. Mindlink does not allow automatic contact across interstellar distances (more than 0.1 light-year), nor can it reach other dimensions, parallel worlds, etc.<br>
Mindlink costs 5 points for a single person, 10 points for 2-9 people, 20 points for 10-99 people, 30 points for 100-999 people, and so on - add 10 points per tenfold increase in the number of people.<br>
As a rule, the GM should only permit PCs to buy Mindlinks with Allies, Contacts, and Dependents; duplicates (see Duplication, p. 50); and other PCs (if their players permit).<br>
Special Modifiers You may give Mindlink the same modifiers as your Mind Reading or Telesend advantage. In most cases, the GM should require this.</p,></div></div></body>
