<div><h2 class='points'>5 points</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You are driven to exceed your normal limits in one specific pursuit. You must state this exactly as if it were a Code of Honor disadvantage (p. 127): Defend all women, Slay all demons, etc. If, in the GM's judgment, you are unfaltering in your pursuit of your Higher Purpose, you get +1 to all die rolls that pertain directly to the pursuit of your cause. If you deviate from your Higher Purpose, you lose this bonus . . . and the GM is free to penalize you for bad roleplaying just as if you had ignored a Code of Honor.<br>
A Higher Purpose must be specific. Higher Purposes such as Fight evil or Oppose authority figures are too broad to be balanced. In addition, a Higher Purpose must entail genuine risk and inconvenience. The GM should not allow pragmatic Higher Purposes like Faithfully serve my superiors. All Higher Purposes are subject to GM approval.</p,></div></div></body>
