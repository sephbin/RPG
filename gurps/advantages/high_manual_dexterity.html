<div><h2 class='points'>5 points/level</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You have remarkably fine motor skills. Each level (to a maximum of four) gives +1 to DX for tasks that require a delicate touch. This includes all DX-based rolls against Artist, Jeweler, Knot-Tying, Leatherworking, Lockpicking, Pickpocket, Sewing, Sleight of Hand, and Surgery, as well as DX-based rolls to do fine work with Machinist or Mechanic (e.g., on clockwork). This bonus doesn't apply to IQbased tasks or large-scale DX-based tasks, nor does it apply to combatrelated die rolls of any kind.</p,></div></div></body>
