<div><p class='card'>You can change your surface pattern to blend into your surroundings. In any situation where being seen is a factor, you get +2 per level to Stealth skill when perfectly still, or +1 per level if moving. Clothing reduces this bonus to +1 per level when you are motionless, with no bonus if you are moving (unless the clothing is, in the GM's opinion, camouflaged relative to your current environment).<br>
Chameleon does not normally help in the dark or against someone relying upon senses other than sight. However, you can specify that your ability is effective against a particular visual or scanning sense (e.g., Infravision or Radar) instead of normal vision.<br>
<hr>
</p><h3 class="card">Special Enhancements</h3><p class="card">
Extended: Your ability affects more than one visual or scanning sense. Each sense beyond the first is +20%.<br>
Controllable: You can consciously select your surface pattern. The effects are mainly aesthetic, but there's a useful side benefit: you can assume a high-visibility pattern that gives +2 per level to your attempts to signal others and distract enemies, and to others' rolls to spot you. This is mutually exclusive with Always On. +20%.<br>
Dynamic: Your surface pattern adapts instantly to new surroundings and corrects for motion blur. You get your full Stealth bonus (+2 per level) when moving. +40%.<br>

</p><h3 class="card">Special Limitations</h3><p class="card">
Always On: You cannot turn this ability off. Strangers react at -1; the flickering effect is irritating. -10%.</p,></div></div></body>
