<div><p class='card'>You can see ultraviolet light (UV). Solar UV is present outdoors during the day, even under cloud cover, but is stopped by window glass or any solid barrier (earth, stone, etc.). Fluorescent lamps also emit UV. Provided UV is present, you can make out more colors than those with normal vision. This helps you discern outlines; spot trace quantities of dust, dyes, etc.; and identify minerals and plants. You get +2 to all Vision rolls made in the presence of UV, as well as to all Forensics, Observation, and Search rolls to spot clues or hidden objects.<br>
At night, a small amount of UV reaches the ground from the stars. This doesn't let you see in the dark, but it does let you ignore -2 in darkness penalties (cumulative with Night Vision). UV penetrates farther underwater than visible light. This lets you halve all vision penalties underwater (but in total darkness, you are as blind as anyone else).<br>
Cost depends on your capabilities:<br>
You can only see UV, and are blind indoors, underground, or anywhere else there is no UV, even when there are normal light sources present: 0 points.<br>
You can see both visible light and UV: 10 points.</p,></div></div></body>
