<div><p class='card'>You have the knack of knowing exactly what to say - and when to say it - around your social betters. You are exempt from reaction penalties due to differences in Rank or Status. In situations where there would be no such penalty, you get +1 on reactions from those who demand respect (priests, kings, etc.). This is a cinematic advantage!</p,></div></div></body>
