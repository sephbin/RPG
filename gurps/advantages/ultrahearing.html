<div><p class='card'>You can hear sounds in the frequencies above the normal range of human hearing (20 kHz). This allows you to hear dog whistles, sonar, motion detectors, etc. You can detect active sonar at twice its effective range. Cost depends on your capabilities:<br>
You can hear only high-frequency sounds: 0 points.<br>
You can hear high-frequency sounds and other sounds: 5 points.<br>
This advantage is included in Ultrasonic Speech, below; if you have Ultrasonic Speech, you cannot take this as well (but don't need to).</p,></div></div></body>
