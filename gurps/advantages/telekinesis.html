<div><p class='card'>You can move objects without touching them. In effect, you manifest an invisible force that acts under your conscious direction at a distant point. Specify how you do this; possibilities include magnetism, psionic psychokinesis, an ultra-tech tractor beam, or a supernatural poltergeist effect.<br>
You can manipulate distant objects just as if you were grasping them in a pair of hands with ST equal to your Telekinesis (TK) level. You can move any object you have strength enough to lift, at a Move equal to your TK level, modified as usual for encumbrance level (see Encumbrance and Move, p. 17). Regardless of level, maximum range is 10 yards. To modify range, take Increased Range (p. 106) or Reduced Range (p. 115).<br>
Telekinesis requires constant concentration to use. In combat, this means you must take a Concentrate maneuver on your turn. Your TK may then perform one standard maneuver as if were a disembodied pair of hands at some point within your range: a Ready maneuver to pick up an object; a Move maneuver to lift and carry it; an Attack maneuver to throw it, or to grab or strike directly; and so on.<br>
Example: On your turn in combat, you take a Concentrate maneuver and state that your TK is taking an Attack maneuver to grab a gun from a foe. The following turn, you can Concentrate again and specify that your TK is taking an Aim or Wait maneuver to cover your enemy with the gun, an Attack maneuver to shoot him, or a Move maneuver to bring the gun to your hand.<br>
No rolls are necessary for ordinary lifting and movement. For more complex actions, the GM might require you to make a DX or skill roll. In situations where you would roll against ST, roll against your TK level instead.<br>
All of the above assumes that you are using TK to perform a task at a distance. TK can also discreetly assist you with such skills as Gambling (especially to cheat!), Lockpicking, and Surgery. In general, anything that would benefit from High Manual Dexterity (p. 59) gets a +4 bonus if you can successfully make an IQ roll to use your TK properly. On a failure, the GM may assess any penalty he feels is appropriate.<br>
Grappling and Striking: You can use TK to attack a foe directly. Roll against DX or an unarmed combat skill to hit. Your foe defends as if attacked by an invisible opponent (see Visibility, p. 394). If you grapple, your foe cannot grab hold of the TK force, but he can try to break free as usual - and if he also has TK, he can take a Concentrate maneuver and use his TK level instead of his ST. The turn after you grapple a foe using TK, your TK can use a Move maneuver to pick him up off the ground, provided you have enough TK to lift his weight. Someone in this position can't do anything that relies on ground contact (run, retreat, etc.), but can perform any other action that is possible while grappled.<br>
Levitation: If you have enough TK to lift your own body weight, you can levitate. Take the Concentrate maneuver and have your TK take Move maneuvers to propel your body. For true psychokinetic flight, take Flight (p. 56) with the Psychokinetic limitation (below).<br>
Throwing: By applying a TK impulse for a fraction of a second, you can throw objects faster (and farther) than you can move them. Take a Concentrate maneuver and have your TK take an Attack maneuver. This works just as if you were throwing the object with ST equal to your TK level. Roll against Throwing or Thrown Weapon skill to hit, depending on the object being hurled. For 1/2D and Max purposes, measure range from the object (not yourself!) to the target; for the purpose of range penalties, use the sum of the distance from you to the object and from the object to the target. Once you throw something, you have released your telekinetic grip - your TK must take a Ready maneuver to pick it up again.<br>
Animated Objects: A spirit that uses Possession to occupy an object (like a statue) can use TK with Animation (-30%) to make it move around. If the spirit can only use its TK in conjunction with Possession, add an Accessibility limitation (-10%). A sorcerer who makes tables gallop and mannequins dance has Animation, too - with Independent (+70%), if the items keep doing what they're doing without his attention. Together, Animation and Independent can animate one object per second. Total HP can't exceed TK level, but homogenous objects count as having half their HP.<br>
Attraction/Repulsion Field: Some force fields push everything nearby away from the user, or draw objects to him. Simulate this using Area Effect (+50%/level), Emanation (-20%), and one of Attraction (-60%), Repulsion (-60%), or Attraction/Repulsion (-30%). If the field is magnetic, add Magnetic (-50%), too. Being unable to turn this off is genuinely limiting - Always On is worth -20%.<br>
Poltergeist Effect: Certain people are the nexus of random acts of telekinetic violence when under stress. Parapsychologists refer to this phenomenon as recurrent spontaneous psychokinesis (RSPK) or the poltergeist effect. Represent this with Area Effect (+50%/level), Emanation (-20%), Unconscious Only (-20%), and Uncontrollable (-30%). In general, combinations of Area Effect and Uncontrollable always cause chaos over a wide area.<br>
Psychokinesis: Classic psionic psychokinesis is TK with the Psychokinesis power modifier (-10%).<br>
Super-Magnetism: Some supers direct magnetic forces with laserlike precision. This isn't realistic - all it has in common with real-world magnetism is that it can only affect ferrous metals, which calls for Magnetic (-50%). Increased Range (+10%/level) is common but not required.<br>
Tractor Beam: Superscience devices that project force beams capable of pushing or pulling distant objects are found on starships, robots, and mecha. These tractor beams typically have high levels of Increased Range (+10%/level) and either Attraction (-60%) or Attraction/Repulsion (-30%), and are often Visible (-20%).<br>
Super-Effort: The GM may allow the Super-Effort enhancement from Lifting ST (p. 58) on TK, too. This affects extra-effort lifts - not speed, damage, skill, or anything else. The only differences from the Lifting ST rules are that TK with Super-Effort works at a range and that its bonus adds to levels of TK that lack this modifier, not to personal ST (e.g., TK 20 gives ST 5,000, or adds 5,000 to unmodified TK, if any).<br>

</p><h3 class="card">Special Limitations</h3><p class="card">
Magnetic: Your TK is super magnetism, and only affects ferrous metals: iron (including steel), nickel, and cobalt. -50%.<br>
Psychokinetic: Your ability is part of the Psychokinesis psi power (see p. 256). This makes it mental (2) rather than physical (3). -10%.<br>
Visible: Your TK is not an invisible force, but a disembodied hand, glowing tractor beam, or similar. This makes it much easier for others to defend against your TK attacks (do not use the Visibility rules). -20%.<br>
Animation: Your TK works by enabling inanimate objects to flex. The minimum level required to animate something equals its HP if unliving, half its HP if homogenous (see Object Hit Points Table, p. B558). An animated object can grab, lift, strike, and throw with ST equal to the TK level needed to animate it. It has your DX. It can walk and jump if it isn't fixed in place; Move equals your TK level minus the level needed to animate it. You can use skills through animated items - but note that objects other than statues and mannequins usually have No Fine Manipulators. Objects return to their rest state once you give up control. Adding Independent (p. 108) lets you animate multiple objects, but you must split your TK level among them. Your TK can't reach inside things at all. -30% if the object can't fly; -20% if it can, provided it has wings, rotors, etc. (like a toy dragon or model helicopter).<br>
Attraction/Repulsion: Your TK can only move things directly toward or away from you. Take a Ready maneuver to move an unresisting object, or an Attack maneuver to affect an active opponent. Your TK can't strike blows, manipulate objects, or hold an enemy in place or prevent him from attacking. Attraction simply causes objects to move until they're in contact with you, whereupon they're held there with your telekinetic ST until you turn off your ability. Repulsion shoves objects away from you until they reach the maximum range of your ability. In either case, objects can only move or be moved in the opposite direction if the mover wins a Quick Contest of his ST or TK level against your TK level. This limitation is incompatible with Animation. -60% for Attraction or Repulsion; -30% for Attraction/Repulsion (it takes a Ready maneuver to switch between the two).<br>
Lift Only: Levels of TK with this limitation don't add to telekinetic Move. -20%.<br>
Move Only: Levels of TK with this limitation don't add to telekinetic ST. -40%.</p,></div></div></body>
