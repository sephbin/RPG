<div><p class='card'>You can alter the ambient temperature. Heating or cooling is limited to 20째 per level, and occurs at a rate of 2째 per level per second of concentration. You can affect a two-yard radius at a distance of up to 10 yards. Use Increased Range (p. 106) or Reduced Range (p. 115) to modify range; add levels of Area Effect (p. 102) to increase radius.<br>
This ability never does damage directly. For that, buy Innate Attack - usually either burning (for flame) or fatigue (for attacks that damage by altering body temperature).<br>
Active: Psis, supers, and ultra-tech machines cause temperature changes using force of will or weird beams. Freeze rays and cryokinesis call for Cold (-50%), while heat rays and pyrokinesis require Heat (-50%). For dramatic effects like freezing or boiling water instantly, add Reduced Time (+20%/level); each level doubles the rate of cooling or heating.<br>
Passive: Spirits, monsters, and elemental creatures of heat and cold sometimes alter the temperature in their immediate vicinity (a two-yard radius) at all times. To simulate this, add Always On (-10%), Emanation (-20%), and either Cold (-50%) or Heat (-50%). The ambient temperature changes by 2째 per level per second the entity remains in the area, to the usual maximum of 20째 per level.<br>

</p><h3 class="card">Special Limitations</h3><p class="card">
Cold: You can only decrease the temperature. -50%.<br>
Heat: You can only increase the temperature. -50%.<br>
Psychokinetic: Your ability is part of the Psychokinesis psi power (see p. 256), often called cryokinesis (for cold) or pyrokinesis (for heat). -10%.</p,></div></div></body>
