<body><div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>BLESSED</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>10 or more points</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You are attuned to a god, demon lord, great spirit, cosmic power, etc. This can take various forms, but in all cases, you will lose this advantage if you fail to act in accordance with your deity's rules and values.<br>
Blessed: You sometimes receive wisdom from your deity. After communing with your god (meditating, praying, etc.) for at least one hour, you see visions or witness omens that have some bearing on future events. Work out the details with your GM; for instance, the God of Fire might require you to stare into flames for an hour, after which you hear a voice in the flames. The GM rolls secretly against your IQ to determine whether you gain any useful insight from this experience. The ritual is fatiguing, however; at the end of the hour, you lose 10 FP. As a side benefit, followers of your deity sense your special status and react to you at +1. 10 points.<br>
Very Blessed: As above, but your IQ roll to interpret visions is at +5 and the reaction bonus from your god's followers is +2. 20 points.<br>
Heroic Feats: Your blessing gives you the ability to perform a particular heroic feat. Once per game session, you may add 1d to one of ST, DX, or HT (other traits, such as Basic Move, are at the GM's discretion). You must specify which trait is boosted when you buy the advantage. This bonus lasts 3d seconds, after which your abilities revert to normal and you suffer any penalties amassed during the heroic period. (For instance, if your blessing boosts HP and you are reduced to -5 x your normal HP but not -5 x your blessed HP, you will die when the bonus HP wear off unless you receive some sort of healing.) 10 points.<br>
The GM may choose to allow other blessings as well.</p,></div></div></body>
