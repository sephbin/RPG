<div><p class='card'>You have a natural aptitude for a set of closely related skills. Talents come in levels, and give the following benefits:<br>
* A bonus of +1 per level with all affected skills, even for default use. This effectively raises your attribute scores for the purpose of those skills only; thus, this is an inexpensive way to be adept at small class of skills. (Generalists will find it more costeffective to raise attributes.)<br>
* A bonus of +1 per level on all reaction rolls made by anyone in a position to notice your Talent, if he would be impressed by your aptitude (GM's judgment). To receive this bonus, you must demonstrate your Talent - most often by using the affected skills.<br>
* A reduction in the time required to learn the affected skills in play, regardless of how you learn them. Reduce the time required by 10% per level of Talent; e.g., Animal Friend 2 would let you learn animal-related skills in 80% the usual time. This has no effect on the point cost of your skills.<br>
You may never have more than four levels of a particular Talent. However, overlapping Talents can give skill bonuses (only) in excess of +4.<br>

Cost of Talents<br>
The cost of a Talent depends on the size of the group of skills affected:<br>
Small (6 or fewer related skills): 5 points/level.<br>
Medium (7 to 12 related skills): 10 points/level.<br>
Large (13 or more related skills): 15 points/level.<br>
Skills with multiple specialties are considered to be one skill for this purpose.<br>
Once you buy a Talent, the list of affected skills is fixed. (Exception: The GM may rule that a Talent affects new skills appearing in later GURPS supplements, or skills he invents in the course of the campaign, if the Talent would logically be of value to those skills.)<br>

Custom Talents<br>
At the GM's option, you may create your own Talent with a custom skill list. However, the GM's word is law when determining which skills are related and how may points the Talent is worth. Talents should always be believable inborn aptitudes. For instance, Sports Talent might make sense - some athletes really do seem to have a gift - but the GM ought to forbid Ninja Talent or Weapon Talent (but see Weapon Master, p. 99).</p,></div></div></body>
