<div><p class='card'>You can walk on the surface of any liquid as if it were solid ground. You move at your usual ground Move. This doesn't protect you from any damage that you would take from coming into contact with the liquid, however. You can't traverse volcanic lava or boiling acid without taking damage!<br>
Submerged: You can walk while under liquid, too. Use the rules for Walk on Air, but a fall just means you're swimming instead of walking. +20%.</p,></div></div></body>
