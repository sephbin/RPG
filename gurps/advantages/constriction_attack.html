<div><p class='card'>Your musculature is optimized for crushing your opponents - whether by hugging like a bear or constricting like a python. To use this ability, you must first successfully grapple your intended victim, whose Size Modifier (p. 19) cannot exceed your own. On your next turn, and each successive turn, roll a Quick Contest: your ST vs. your victim's ST or HT, whichever is higher. If you win, your victim takes damage equal to your margin of victory; otherwise, he takes no damage.<br>
Engulfing: You totally engulf your victim. If he doesn't break free between when you grapple him and when you start to crush him, he's pinned; see Pin (p. B370). This pin is completely hands free. Victims with abilities such as Innate Attack and Spines can hit you automatically while engulfed, however. If so, you get no active defense. +60%.</p,></div></div></body>
