<body><div class='card'><div class='title'><h1 class='white'>SCANNING SENSE</h1></div>
<div><h2 class='points'>Variable</h2></div>
<div><p class='card'>You can emit energy, bounce it off objects, and analyze the returned signal to build up a picture of your surroundings. This lets you discern size and shape, but not color or fine detail (such as writing). It has nothing to do with the normal human sense of sight, and requires no light. As a result, you may ignore darkness penalties in combat. Perception is limited to a 120° arc in front of you.<br>
Your sense is active. Anyone who can sense the signal you emit can detect you, out to twice your own range. Unlike other sensory advantages, however, you can turn this ability off; see Turning Advantages Off and On (p. 34).<br>
Below are several varieties of Scanning Sense. Each is a separate advantage, with its own special rules. Where these rules contradict the general ones given above, follow the special rules. Each sense also has a base range. To adjust this, take Increased Range (p. 106) or Reduced Range (p. 115).<br>
Radar: Your Scanning Sense uses radio waves. Base range is 2,000 yards. You can only detect large (humansized or larger), dense objects. On a Sense roll, you get a general idea of the relative size of the object, and whether it is moving, but nothing more precise. You cannot get an actual image with Radar, or use it to aim attacks. Radar works best on flying targets; roll at -4 to spot anyone who is not silhouetted against the sky. Radar does not work at all underwater. 20 points.<br>
Imaging Radar: Your Scanning Sense uses millimeter-wave radar. Base range is 200 yards. You can spot small objects and determine their shape, but you must make a Sense roll to distinguish fine relief (e.g., to identify a face). Imaging Radar can see through thin fabric or vegetation. You get +3 to locate objects like concealed weapons, and may ignore penalties for spotting objects hidden behind light brush. Ordinary radar detectors detect Imaging Radar at -4. Imaging Radar does not work underwater. 20 points.<br>
Ladar: Your Scanning Sense uses a laser beam. Base range is 200 yards. Ladar is very similar to Imaging Radar, but the beam is narrower and offers better resolution. This gives -4 on rolls to locate objects of interest, but +4 on rolls to identify them. Only specialized ladar detectors can detect Ladar, and at -4 even then. Ladar cannot penetrate dense smoke or solid objects. It has 10-50% range in falling rain or snow, and 1% range underwater. 20 points.<br>
Para-Radar: Your Scanning Sense uses energy unknown to 21st-century science. Treat Para-Radar as Imaging Radar, except that it functions in any environment! Ordinary radar detectors cannot detect Para-Radar, although some ultra-tech sensors might be able to do so. 40 points.<br>
Sonar: Your Scanning Sense uses ultrasonic sound waves. Base range is 2,000 yards underwater. You can spot small objects and determine their shape, but you must make a Sense roll to distinguish fine relief (e.g., to identify a face). Sonar does not function if you are deafened, and can be jammed or fooled by a very loud noise (e.g., an explosion). Individuals with Ultrahearing can detect Sonar. Sonar is much less effective in air: range is only 20 yards multiplied by air pressure in atmospheres (one atmosphere on Earth). Sonar is completely ineffective in vacuum. 20 points.<br>
Active IR: Your Scanning Sense uses an infrared (IR) beam. Base range is 200 yards. It can distinguish fine relief as well as the human eye; if someone using ordinary vision could identify details without a die roll, then so can you. Only IR detectors and those with Infravision (p. B60) can detect Active IR. You can switch off your beam in order to avoid detection, in which case this ability functions as Infravision (but when turned on, it can spot targets that don't emit heat). Active IR doesn't work underwater. 20 points.<br>
T-Ray Vision: Your Scanning Sense uses sub-millimeter-wave radar, bordering on the infrared. Base range is 200 yards. Like Imaging Radar, T-Ray Vision can spot small objects and determine their shape, and eliminates penalties to spot objects behind light cover. However, T-Ray Vision is more precise. It gets +4 to locate concealed weapons, and while it still requires a Sense roll to distinguish fine relief, this roll is also at +4. Only rare, special- purpose sensors can detect TRay Vision. T-Ray Vision doesn't work underwater. 25 points.<br>

</p><h3 class="card">Special Enhancements</h3><p class="card">
Extended Arc: You can scan an arc greater than 120°. A 240° arc (as described for Peripheral Vision, p. 74) is +75%; a 360° arc (as described for 360° Vision, p. 34) is +125%.<br>
Low-Probability Intercept (LPI): This is only available for Radar and Sonar. You can switch this enhancement on and off. Turning it on makes your signal difficult to detect. This halves range, but your Scanning Sense can only be detected at 1.5 times the halved range. +10%.<br>
Multi-Mode: This is only available for Radar. You can switch between Radar and Imaging Radar. (This is much cheaper than buying the two advantages separately, because they overlap to some extent.) +50%.<br>
Penetrating: This is only available for Para-Radar. You can see inside any object within range. This functions exactly as Penetrating Vision 2 (p. 74). +50%.<br>
Targeting: By taking an Aim maneuver, you can lock onto any object within range and determine its precise range and speed - just as if you had a high-tech rangefinder. This gives you +3 to hit that target with an aimed ranged attack. +20%.<br>
Bio-Scan: Para-Radar only. You receive vital signs and biochemical information from anything you scan - both the target itself and anything living on its surface. This lets you use skills like Biology and Diagnosis from a safe distance. With Penetrating, you can also examine living beings inside inanimate objects (e.g., the passengers of a car). +50%.<br>
No Intercept: Your Scanning Sense is completely undetectable. This highly unrealistic enhancement mainly suits psis and supers. +50%.<br>
Scanner: Para-Radar only. You receive detailed information about the composition, energy output, radiation emissions, etc. of anything you scan. This allows detailed analysis from a distance with scientific skills such as Chemistry and Physics. With Penetrating, you can spot specific systems within a complex machine and analyze them using Engineer skill. Sci-fi sensors typically have both enhancements - and often Bio-Scan, too. +50%.<br>

Targeting Only: As Targeting, but you can only use your sense to lock onto targets already spotted with another sense; you cannot use it to spot things. -40%.</p,></div></div></body>
