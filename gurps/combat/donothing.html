<body><h1>DO NOTHING</h1>
<hr><p class="stats"><b>Movement:</b> None.</p>
<p class="stats"><b>Active Defense:</b> Any (unless you’re tied up, etc.). If you are stunned, however, your active defenses are at -4 until your next turn – even if you recover.</p><hr>
<p>Anyone who is just standing still is assumed to be doing nothing. In particular, when combat begins, anyone who has not yet taken a turn is treated as if he took this maneuver before entering combat.<br>
Someone who is conscious but stunned or surprised must take this maneuver. On each turn of Do Nothing, he may attempt a HT roll to recover from physical stun or an IQ roll to recover from mental stun. On a success, he recovers at the end of his turn – that is, he Does Nothing this turn, but may act normally next turn.</p></body>
