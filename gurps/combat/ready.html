<p>Take a Ready maneuver to pick up or draw any item and prepare it for use; e.g., to pull a sword from its sheath or a gun from its holster, or to reload a firearm. In some cases, you may also need a Ready maneuver to regain control of an unwieldy weapon after a swing, or to adjust the reach of a long weapon – see the Melee Weapon Table (p. 271).<br>
You can use a Ready maneuver to perform physical actions other than fighting: opening or closing a door, picking a lock, digging, lifting, etc.<br>
Continuing activities may require multiple, consecutive Ready maneuvers; see Other Actions in Combat (p. 382).<br>
Finally, a Ready maneuver lets you switch an advantage “off” or “on” if it is not always on and does not require an Attack or Concentrate maneuver to use.<br>
For more information, see Readying Weapons and Other Gear (p. 382) and When Is a Weapon Ready? (p. 382).</p></body>
