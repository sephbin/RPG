<body><h1>ALL-OUT ATTACK</h1>
<hr><p class="stats"><b>Movement:</b> You may move up to half your Move, but you can only move forward.</p>
<p class="stats"><b>Active Defense:</b> You may make no active defenses at all from the point you take this maneuver until your next turn. If someone attacks you after you make an All-Out attack, all you can do is hope he misses – you can’t dodge, parry, or block.</p><hr>
<p>Attack any foe with a ready weapon, making no effort to defend against enemy attacks. If you are making a melee attack, you must specify one of these four options before you attack:<br>
<h2>
Determined<br>
</h2>
<doubleindent>
Make a single attack at +4 to hit.<br>
</doubleindent>
<h2>
Double<br>
</h2>
<doubleindent>
Make two attacks against the same foe, if you have two ready weapons or one weapon that does not have to be readied after use. Attacks with a second weapon held in the off hand are at the usual -4 (see Handedness, p. 14) unless you have Ambidexterity (p. 39).<br>
</doubleindent>
<h2>
Feint<br>
</h2>
<doubleindent>
Make one Feint (see above) and then one attack against the same foe. The Feint applies to this attack instead of one you make on your next turn.<br>
</doubleindent>
<h2>
Strong<br>
</h2>
<doubleindent>
Make a single attack, at normal skill. If you hit, you get +2 to damage – or +1 damage per die, if that would be better. This only applies to melee attacks doing ST-based thrust or swing damage, not to weapons such as force swords.<br>
</doubleindent>
If you are making a ranged attack, you must specify one of these two options before you attack:<br>
<bullet>
• Determined: Make a single attack at +1 to hit.<br>
• Suppression Fire: Take the entire turn to spray an area with automatic fire. This is a full-turn maneuver, and you can only choose this option if your weapon has RoF 5+. See Suppression Fire (p. 409).<br>
