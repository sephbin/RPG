<body><h1>ATTACK</h1>
<hr><p class="stats"><b>Movement:</b> Step. You may step and then attack or attack and then step – your choice. To move further and still attack, take All-Out Attack or Move and Attack.</p>
<p class="stats"><b>Active Defense:</b> Any.</p><hr>
<p>Use this maneuver to make an armed or unarmed attack in melee combat, or to use a thrown or missile weapon in ranged combat. To use a weapon to attack, it must be ready.<br>
If you are using a melee weapon or unarmed attack, your target must be within reach. Resolve the attack as explained under Melee Attacks (pp. 369-372). If you took an Evaluate maneuver (above) last turn, you will have a bonus to hit. If you took a Feint (below), your opponent may have a penalty to defend.<br>
If you are using a ranged weapon, your target must be within the weapon’s Max range. Resolve the attack according to Ranged Attacks (pp. 372-374). If you took an Aim maneuver (p. 364) last turn, you will have a bonus to hit.<br>
<hr><br>
When attacking with a technique, be sure to read its description! Many techniques – especially cinematic ones – don’t allow an ordinary Attack maneuver. They only work with All-Out Attack, Committed Attack, or Move and Attack.<br>
Note also that while Attack allows “any” active defense, some attacks preclude a later parry. In particular:<br>
<bullet>
•If using a weapon that can get stuck (see Picks, p. B405), you cannot parry until you free the weapon.<br>
•If you grab or grapple, the hand(s) you use to grip your foe cannot parry.<br>
•If you strike using a weapon that becomes unready, it cannot parry afterward.<br>
•If you strike using an unbalanced weapon, you cannot parry with it that turn.<br>
