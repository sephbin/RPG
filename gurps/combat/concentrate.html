<body><h1>CONCENTRATE</h1>
<hr><p class="stats"><b>Movement:</b> Step.</p>
<p class="stats"><b>Active Defense:</b> Any. However, it interferes with concentration as noted above.</p><hr>
<p>You concentrate on one primarily mental task (even it has a minor physical component, like operating controls, gesturing, or speaking). This may be casting a magical spell, using a psi ability, making a Sense roll to spot an invisible warrior, making a Leadership roll to give orders, making an Electronics Operation roll to operate a sensor, or any similar action, including most IQ-based skill rolls.<br>
This is a full-turn maneuver.<br>
Some activities (e.g., casting spells) require you to take the Concentrate maneuver for multiple seconds. If you are forced to use an active defense, knocked down, injured, or otherwise distracted before you finish, you must make a Will-3 roll. On a failure, you lose your concentration and must start over.</p></body>
