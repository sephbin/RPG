<body><h1>ALL-OUT DEFENSE</h1>
<hr><p class="stats"><b>Movement:</b> If you choose Increased Dodge, you may move up to half your Move. Otherwise, the only movement you may take is a step.</p>
<p class="stats"><b>Active Defense:</b> You may choose any legal active defense, with bonuses as described above.</p><hr>
<p>This is the maneuver to choose when you’re beset by foes – especially foes who like All-Out Attacks! You must specify one of the following two options:<br>
<bullet>
• Increased Defense: Add +2 to one active defense of your choice: Dodge, Parry, or Block. This bonus persists until your next turn.<br>
• Double Defense: Apply two different active defenses against the same attack. If you fail your defense roll against an attack, you may try a second, different defense against that attack. For instance, if you fail a block, you may try a dodge or a parry. If you try a parry (armed or unarmed) with one hand and fail, a parry using the other hand does count as a “different defense.”<br>
