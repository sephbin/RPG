<body><h1>WAIT</h1>
<hr><p class="stats"><b>Movement:</b> None until your Wait is triggered. At that point, you may move as allowed by the maneuver you specified (Attack, Feint, All-Out Attack, or Ready).</p>
<p class="stats"><b>Active Defense:</b> You may defend normally while you are waiting or after your Wait is triggered. But if you defend while taking a Wait, you may not transform your Wait into an All- Out Attack; you must convert your Wait into an Attack instead.</p><hr>
<p>Do nothing unless a particular event you specified in advance occurs before your next turn; e.g., a foe moves into range. If that happens, you may transform your Wait into an Attack, Feint, All-Out Attack (you must specify the option before acting), or Ready maneuver. If you are reacting to someone else, this interrupts his turn, but he can resume it after you’ve acted.<br>
You must specify exactly what your action will be when you take the Wait maneuver, and what will trigger it. For instance, “I’ll make an All-Out Attack (Determined) with my sword on the first orc to move toward me.”<br>
You may take a Wait with a ready ranged weapon; this is known as “covering” a target or area. If so, you must specify the zone that you are covering with that weapon. There is no penalty to cover a one-yard area. For larger areas and additional rules, see Opportunity Fire (p. 390).<br>
You can use the Wait maneuver for any “reflex action” you want to plan in advance, provided you specify both the response and the action that will trigger it. This can include holding a knife at a hostage’s throat, or even a noncombat action (e.g., “If Dora sees any orcs, she will pull this rope immediately – otherwise, she does nothing.”). An action only qualifies as a “reflex” if you could do it in a single motion. The GM’s decision is final.<br>
Finally, you can use Wait to coordinate actions with slower friends.<br>
Stop Thrust: If you have a ready thrusting weapon, you can use a Wait to brace your weapon to receive a possible enemy charge. Simply state, “I brace for a stop thrust.” You can convert your Wait into an Attack or All-Out Attack against any one foe that moves one or more yards toward you to make a melee attack (armed or unarmed, including a slam or a grapple) or evade (see Evading, p. 368). You strike first if you have the longer reach. If you hit and your foe fails to defend, add +1 to thrust damage for every two full yards your attacker moved toward you.</p></body>
